It's been more than 8 months since I got certified for the eJPT, and by the way, you can watch the video on my YouTube channel talking about my experience and preparation for this certification. And, the truth is, I've been putting off taking the ecpptv2, so I bought the voucher, which is access to the exam and expires in 6 months; so now there are no excuses.

The goal of this video is to create a clear learning path to avoid wasting time on unnecessary or unimportant things. Basically, I'm going to curate the content on the Internet and based on my experience and what I consider important, I'll create a path that will allow you to get this certification as quickly as possible without having to jump from one site to another and waste your valuable time.

I'm doing my homework with OBSIDIAN
Obsidian  is a software for taking notes and creating a personal knowledge base, which works with Markdown files. It allows you to create links between notes and visually see how they are connected in the form of a graph. This helps you organize and structure ideas and knowledge in a flexible and creative way. Plus, it's free for personal use.
