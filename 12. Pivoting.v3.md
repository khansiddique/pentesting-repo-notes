# Pivoting in Cybersecurity

## Introduction
Pivoting is an essential technique in the world of cybersecurity that involves moving laterally within a compromised network to access additional systems and resources. This technique is used by security professionals to maintain and expand access across a compromised infrastructure.

## What is Pivoting?
In simple terms, pivoting refers to the action of using a compromised machine as an entry point to access other systems within the network. This technique is particularly useful when access has been gained to a perimeter system and one is looking to infiltrate deeper network segments.

## Types of Pivoting
There are several types of pivoting depending on how the lateral movement is performed:

- **Direct Pivoting:** It is performed from the compromised machine to other systems within the same network.
- **Pivoting Across Jumps:** Involves moving across multiple engaged machines to reach the desired goal.
- **Chain Pivoting:** This involves connecting several compromised systems to reach the target network.
  
## Tools and Techniques
To carry out pivoting, security professionals use specific tools and techniques, such as:

- **SSH Tunneling:** Establish secure connections over SSH to redirect traffic.
- **Proxychains:** Routing traffic through a chain of proxies.
- **Port Forwarding:** Port redirection to access internal services.
- **VPN and Socks:** Use of VPN or SOCKS servers to hide the origin of traffic.

## Importance in Cybersecurity
Pivoting is a crucial skill for security analysts and pentesters, as it allows them to understand the breadth of a breach and assess potential exposure on a compromised network. It also helps identify and remediate potential entry points and lateral movement in future attacks.
